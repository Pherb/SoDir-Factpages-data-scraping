Well: 30/2-1
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 30/2-1 is located roughly mid-way between the Oseberg Field complex and the Kvitebjørn Field in the Northern North Sea. The primary objective of the well was sandstones of Middle Jurassic age. Secondary objectives were sandstones of Paleocene and Late/Early Triassic age.
                


Operations and results


Wildcat well 30/2-1 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Dyvi Delta on 17 May 1982 and drilled to TD at 4243 m, 133 m into the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation. A total of 125 days were spent on the drilling phase, which was 5 days more than prognosed. Twelve days were lost due to problems with lost circulation, gas influx, stuck pipe and a leaking liner overlap in the 8 1/2" hole section. Three and a half days were lost to free the 13 3/8" casing when this got stuck at 1998 m. Most of those days were caught up because total depth was reached 357 m shallower than prognosed, and because of successfully turbodrilling with diamond bits in the 12 1/4" and 6" hole section. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 1035 m, with Gypsum mud from 1035 m to 1860 m, and with Gypsum/Lignosulphonate mud from 1860 m to 2155 m. An oilfaze/pipelax and an Imco spot/pipelax pill was spotted at 1998 m to free the pipe. From 2155 to TD the well was drilled with Spersene XP 20 (Lignosulphonate).


Hydrocarbons were encountered in the Brent group. The secondary prospects were found to be water wet, although oil shows were recorded in dolomite between 1852 m and 1911 m in the Eocene and in a 30 cm thick sandstone bed at 1952 m in the Late Paleocene Balder Formation. Weak shows were also recorded on sandstones from 4119 m to 4202 m in the Statfjord Formation.


Eleven cores were cut with a total recovery of 108.8 metres. Two cores were cut from 1952 m to 1969.5 m in the Late Paleocene Balder Formation, while 9 cores were cut from 3696 m to 3794 m in the Ness, Etive, and Rannoch Formations of the Brent Group. Five RFT runs were made. From the pressure data no hydrocarbon-water contact was seen and it was concluded hat the Brent Group was completely hydrocarbon filled. At 3791 m one 2 3/4 -gallon sample (gas and filtrate) and one 1 -gallon sample (filtrate only) was obtained, and at 3763 m one 2 3/4 -gallon sample (0.85 l condensate) was obtained.


The well was suspended on 12 October 1982 on as a gas/condensate discovery.


Testing


Three DST'S were performed in the well. All three tests produced gas and condensate.
                


DST 1 tested the interval 3785 - 3792 m in the Rannoch Formation. The maximum gas production was about 677000 sm3/day on a 32/64" choke with a GOR of about 2200 Sm3/Sm3. The condensate gravity was 0.804 g/cc and the gas gravity was 0.695 (air = 1). The CO2 content was 2% and the H2S content was nil.
                


DST 2 tested the interval 3761 - 3771 m in the Etive Formation. The maximum production was about 1030000 Sm3/day on a 48/64" choke with a GOR of about 2470 Sm3/Sm3. The condensate gravity was 0.807 g/cc and the gas gravity was 0.695 (air = 1). The CO2 content was 4%.
                


DST 3 tested the interval 3720 - 3728 m in the Etive Formation. The maximum production was about 1016000 Sm3/day on a 48/64" choke with a GOR of approximately 2564 sm3/Sm3. The condensate gravity was 0.814 g/cc and the gas gravity was 0.692 (air = 1). Six ppm H2S and 4 % CO were measured during this test. Sand production was not observed in any of the tests. The gauges used at bottom hole had a temperature limit of 150 deg. C and the measured BHT seemed to approach this limit.

Well: 30/2-2
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 30/2-2 was drilled on the Mokkukalven Fault Complex north of the Oseberg Field in the North Sea.


The objective was
                
to test possible hydrocarbon accumulations in the Huldra Field, on a structural high that is separated from Huldra discovery well 30/2-1 with significant faults. Well 30/2-1 encountered a 119 m gas column in the Brent Group with a down-to contact at 3793 m. The actual gas/water or oil/water contact could not be established. The main target for 30/2-2 was the Brent Group, believed to be some 70 m deeper than the gas column in 30/2-1.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 30/2-2 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Dyvi Delta on 19 December 1984 and drilled to TD at 4172 m in the Early Jurassic Drake Formation. When doing the reservoir logging, a radioactive part of the logging tool was left in the hole. This accident caused a sidetrack from 3894 m KB to TD. The sidetrack ran parallel to the original hole at a distance of approximately 20 m. The intention was to drill 50 m into the Statfjord Formation, but the well was finished in the Drake Formation due to hole conditions. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 214 m, with gel/seawater from 214 m to 1023 m, with gypsum/CMC mud from 1023 m to 3802 m, and with gel/lignosulphonate from 3802 m to TD.


Gas bearing Brent sandstone was encountered at 3935 m, with the gas-water contact somewhere in the interval 3975 - 4080 m. No distinct contact was possible to recognize from logs or shows, but later geochemical analyses of the corers indicated a contact at ca 3984 m. Fluorescence indicating shows was first recorded on claystone/limestone cuttings in the interval 2204 m to 2267 m in the Lista Formation. Intermittent golden cut was observed on cuttings samples in the interval 2489 m to 2585 m in the Shetland Group. Otherwise, oil/condensate shows were recorded on sandstones from the Brent Group through the hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir. Below the contact, weak shows believed to relate to in-situ kerogen in coals and shales were recorded down to TD.


A total of 157 m conventional core was recovered in eighteen cores in the interval from 3908 m in the lower Heather Formation, through all of Brent Group and down to 4139.1 m in the uppermost Drake Formation. All cores were cut in the original hole, before side-tracking. Log runs 1 to 5 were also run in the original hole, while run 6 and 7 were run in the sidetrack. No wire line fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 4 May 1985 as a gas appraisal well.


Testing




Three drill stem tests were conducted in the Brent Group.


DST 1B tested the interval 4071 - 4076 m in the Etive Formation. The test flowed water at only five m3/day through a 19.05 mm choke during a 7.07 hours flow period. The maximum temperature reading was 150 °C. DST 1A failed due to technical problems.


DST 2B tested the intervals 4011-4013 m, 4017-4025 m, and 4035 - 4042 m in the Ness Formation. The test flowed water at only eight m3/day through a 19.05 mm choke during a 13.5 hours flow period. The maximum temperature reading was 148 °C. DST 2A failed due to technical problems.


DST 3 tested the intervals 3935 - 3949 m, 3955 – 3959 m, and 3967-3974 m in the Tarbert Formation. It produced 227600 Sm3 gas and 105 Sm3 condensate /day through a 19.05 mm choke. The GOR was 2170 Sm3/Sm3. The maximum temperature reading was 137 °C.

Well: 30/2-3
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 30/2-2 was drilled on the Huldra Field in the North Sea.


The objective was
                
to appraise the gas/condensate discovery in the Brent Group and reduce the gas-in-place estimates for the field.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 30/2-2 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Ross Isle on 11 June 1992  and drilled to TD at 4325 m in the Early Jurassic Eiriksson Formation. A pilot hole was drilled to 520 m to check for shallow gas. No gas was detected. Drilling proceeded without significant problems. Tool sticking was common in the reservoir section during logging runs. The well was drilled with seawater down to 209 m, with gel spud mud from 209 m to 1115 m, with gypsum/polymer mud from 1115 m to 2298 m, and with Ancotherm mud from 2298 m to TD.


Although a well-defined Gas-Water-contact was encountered in 30/2-3 at 3896 m, this was some 75 m shallower than the previously deepest gas-down-to for well 30/2-2. This indicates that the Huldra Field is more complex than previously thought. Good porosity and permeability were encountered in all gas bearing intervals, reducing uncertainties regarding well productivity. There were no shows above Brent reservoir level. Below the GWC weak shows on sandstone in the cores gradually diminished down to 3962 m where shows disappeared altogether.


A total of 178.4 m core was recovered in 17 cores, from 3749 m in the Heather Formation through all of the Brent Group and down to 3985 m at top Drake Formation. The core-to-log depth correction varied between -0.4 to +1.9 m. No wire line fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 5 October 1992 as a gas/condensate appraisal well.


Testing




Three drill stem tests were performed in the Brent Group.


DST 1 tested the interval 3895 - 3898 m in the Ness Formation. The average production rates towards the end of the Cleanup/ Main Flow period were approximately 43000 Sm3/d of gas, 24 Sm3/d of condensate and 129 Sm3/d of formation water. This proved a GWC in the tested interval. The condensate density was 0.810 g/cm3 and the gas gravity was 0.720 (air =1). The temperature at reference depth 3895 m was 149.0 °C.


DST 2 tested the interval 3874 - 3881 m in the Ness Formation. The average gas and condensate production rates during the Main Flow were 671000 Sm3/d and 319 Sm3/d respectively through a 12.7 mm (32/64") choke size. This gave a GOR close to 2100 Sm3/Sm3 at the prevailing separator conditions. The condensed or dissolved water production was approx. 6-8 m3/d. The condensate density was 0.0.800 g/cm3 and the gas gravity was 0.700 (air =1). DST 2 confirmed very good reservoir properties in the tested interval. The temperature at reference depth 3895 m was 147.5 °C.


DST 3 te3sted the interval 3794 -3803 m in the Tarbert Formation. The average gas and condensate production rates during the Main Flow were 466800 Sm3/d and 215 Sm3/d respectively through a 12.7 mm (32/64") choke size. This gave a GOR of approx. 2170 Sm3/Sm3 at the prevailing separator conditions. The condensed or dissolved water production was approx. 4-6 m3/d. The condensate density was 0.0.797 g/cm3 and the gas gravity was 0.0.690 (air =1). DST 3 confirmed moderate reservoir properties in the tested interval. The temperature at reference depth 3895 m was 146.0 °C.

Well: 30/2-4 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 30/2-4 S was drilled from the Huldra Platform location in the Northern Viking Graben in the North Sea. The primary objective of the well was to prove commercial amounts of hydrocarbons in the Statfjord Formation and to acquire information of the reservoir properties. Secondary objectives were to determine the HC-water contact, the thickness of the Statfjord Formation and to explore for hydrocarbons in the Triassic Lunde Formation sandstones.


Operations and results


Well was spudded with the jack-up installation West Epsilon on 1 May 2008 and drilled to final TD at 4325 m (3748 m TVD) in Early Jurassic sediments of the Statfjord Formation.
No shallow gas was observed by the ROV or on the MWD while drilling the 36" hole or the 24" hole.
                
At 2329 m a 900
                
litres gain was recorded, indicating a kick was taking place and the drilling was suspended due to a well control situation. The drill string got stuck and was cut at 1300 m, and the hole was cemented back to 1099 m and sidetracked. The sidetrack (30/2-4 S T2) was kicked off at 1128 m just below the 20" casing shoe, and drilled to final TD. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 1101 m and with XP-07 oil based mud from 1107 m to TD.


The well penetrated rocks of Quaternary, Tertiary, Cretaceous, and Jurassic age. The Statfjord reservoir was encountered at 4309 m, 42.5 m MD shallower than prognosed. The reservoir quality was satisfactory. The reservoir fluid was water and 3 pressure points taken with the LWD Stethoscope tool gave a reservoir formation pressure of 2.00 sg, 0.05 sg higher than the maximum prognosed pore pressure. A gain of 387 litres was recorded and the mud weight was increased from 1.97 to 2.01 sg. Mud losses were experienced when increasing the mud weight. The drilling operations were terminated because of too low margin between the fracture gradient and the pore pressure. The secondary target, the Lunde Formation, was thus not reached. No oil shows were recorded in any section of the well.


No cores were cut. MWD/LWD logs were the only formation logging in the well. Three LWD pressure measurements in the Statfjord Formation confirmed a water gradient in the Formation. Wire line logging was done only to resolve technical problems, not for formation evaluation. No wire line fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 9 August 2008 as a dry well.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 30/3-1
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 30/3-1 is located just north of the Huldra Discovery. It was planned to be drilled in two phases and the primary objective was to test sandstones of the Brent Group. Secondary objectives were sandstones in the Paleocene and in the Lower Jurassic, Cook and Statfjord formations.


Operations and results


Well 30/3-1, Phase I was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Nordskald and drilled to 3718 m in claystone and marls of the Early Cretaceous Cromer Knoll Group. Phase I was drilled without serious problems but the 12 1/4" hole section had to be cut shorter than originally planned due to lost circulation and possibly higher pore pressures than prognosed. The mud gas readings were relatively high through the 17 1/2" section causing long periods of circulation. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 212 m, with a gel mud from 212 m to 985 m, and with a Spersene XP 20/Magcogel/nut plug mud from 985 m to TD.
                


The Paleocene did not contain good reservoirs. Shows and live oil in the mud were however recorded in predominant claystone lithology from 1910 m to 2470 m. No conventional cores were cut and no fluid samples taken.
                


The well was suspended on 7 September as a dry hole after the 9 5/8" casing was run. The plan was to re-enter the well later, using a rig equipped with a 15000 psi BOP stack and drill through the Jurassic sandstones.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 30/3-2
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 30/3-2 is located ca 7 km north of the Oseberg Field in the Northern North Sea. The primary objective of the well was to test sandstones belonging to the Brent and Dunlin group. Secondary objective was sandstones in the Statfjord formation.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 30/3-2 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Saga on 4 July 1980. Due to a strike beginning at July 13 drilling was temporary abandoned at 955 m in Miocene sediments of the Hordaland Group. The well was drilled with pre-hydrated gel.


No cores were cut and no wire line fluid samples were taken.


The well was suspended on 15 August 1980 and the rig was taken to Bergen. The strike was terminated on 14 August and the rig was back on location on August 29. The well was re-entered and operations resumed, now formally as a new well, 30/3-2 R.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 30/3-3
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 30/3-3 was drilled on the Lomre Terrace between the Veslefrikk and Brage oil fields. The primary objective was sandstone of the Middle Jurassic Brent Group, the secondary objective was sandstone of the Early Jurassic Dunlin Group.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 30/3-3 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Ross Isle on 2 April 1983 and drilled to TD at 3419 m in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation. No significant problem was encountered in the operations. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 969 m, with gypsum/lignosulphonate/CMC from 969 m to 2861 m, and gel/lignosulphonate/CMC from 2861 m to TD.


The well was dry. Oil shows were described on sandstone cuttings from 3035 - 3037 m in the uppermost Etive Formation and from 3185 m to TD. Sandstone side wall cores from the same interval had no shows, and geochemical extracts proved only immature hydrocarbons from in-situ shales.


One core was cut in the Ness Formation from 2979 m to 2992.5 m. No wire line fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 30 May 1983 as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 30/3-4
Wellbore history
 





General


Appraisal well 30/3-4 was drilled on the Veslefrikk Field. The primary objectives of the well were to investigate possible oil accumulations in sandstones in Ness and Etive Formations, and to determine the oil/water contact. Secondary objective was sandstone of the Early Jurassic Dunlin Group.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 30/3-4 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Bergen on 5 February 1985 and drilled to TD at 3287 m in Early Jurassic sediments of the Statfjord Formation. Drilling went without problems to a depth of 1788 m. While running the 13 3/8" casing a wedge got stuck in the BOP and locked the casing. A technical sidetrack was decided. The sidetrack was kicked off from 790 m, and drilled to 1792 m. An attempt to set 13 3/8" casing at this depth was unsuccessful, as the shoe got stuck at 1178 m. The casing was cut at 872 m and a second technical sidetrack was kicked of from 630 m. The problems encountered while running casing might have been caused by differential pressure between the Utsira sand and a sand at 1700 m. A total of 4 weeks was spent on the 17 1/2" section before the 13 3/8" casing was finally in place. Drilling to TD proceeded without further problems. The interval below 3131 m was drilled with turbine. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills to 248 m, with gel/seawater from 248 m to 606 m, and with KCl/polymer mud in the 17 1/2" section from 606 m to 1605 m. In the final 17 12/2" sidetrack from 630 m "Torq Trim" and 7% diesel was added to the mud. The 12 1/4" section from 1605 m to 2812 m was drilled with KCl/polymer mud, and the 8 1/2" section from 2812 m to TD was drilled with Lignite/Lignosulphonate mud.
                


Hydrocarbons were encountered in both Ness and Etive Formations and in the secondary target, the Cook Formation. Top reservoir in the Brent Group is at 2843 m, and the oil/water contact is at 2930 m. Top Cook Formation sand came in at 3079 m, and the possible oil/ water contact is at 3129 m. Twelve cores were cut in 8 1/2" hole from 2830 - 2972 m and 3086 - 3131 m, covering both reservoir sections. No fluid sample was taken on wire line.


The well was suspended on 12 June 1985 for possible later use as a producer. It is classified as an oil/gas appraisal.


Testing


Six Drill Stem Tests were performed with good results. The high production rate from Cook Formation was especially interesting.
                


DST 1 from 3079 m to 3096 m (Cook Formation) produced 1023 m oil/day and 114 800 m gas/day on 60/64" choke and wellhead pressure equal to 54 bar.


DST 2 from 2932 m to 2941 m (Etive Formation) flowed for 2 hours on 48/64" choke and produced 580 m water/day and wellhead pressure equal to 37 bars. A water injection test was performed.


DST 3 from 2903 m to 2923 m (Etive Formation) produced 1640 m oil/day and 126 700 m gas/day on 56/64" choke and wellhead pressure equal to 90 bar.


DST 4 from 2866 m to 2882 m (Ness/Etive Formations) produced 1230 m oil/day and 101 900 m gas/day on 46/64" choke and wellhead pressure equal to 103 bar.


DST 5 from 2850 m to 2857 m (Ness Formation) produced 578 m oil/day and 46 200 m gas/day on 48/64" choke and wellhead pressure equal to 41 bar.


DST 6 from 2826 m 2833 m (a separate sandstone section in top Ness Formation) produced 237 m water/day on 1" choke and wellhead pressure equal to 4 bar.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 30/3-9
Wellbore history
 





General


The purpose of well 30/3-9 was to prove minimum economical volumes of hydrocarbons in the Brent Group within the C-prospect, and to possibly identify a down flank hydrocarbon/water contact within the Brent Group. The C-prospect is situated within an easterly dipping terrace, north of the Oseberg platform. The 30/3-9 well was the first well drilled on this structural segment.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 30/3-9 was spudded on 24 April 2000 with the semi-submersible installation "West Alpha" and drilled to a total depth of 4015 m in the Early Jurassic Drake Formation. No shallow gas was encountered. The well was drilled with seawater with hi-vis pills and bentonite mud down to 1027 m, and with KCl/polymer/glycol mud ("Glydril" with 3.5 % glycol) from 1027 m to 2466 m. The well was then displaced to oil based "VersaPro" mud and drilled with this mud through the 12 1/4" section to 3712 m. Circulation was lost at 3644 m and 294 m3 "VersaPro" was lost to the formation. The 8 1/2" section (3712 m to TD) was drilled with KCl/polymer/glycol mud ("Glydril" with 2.5 % glycol). Thin gas-charged stringers were encountered at 2113 m (sandstone in the Lista Formation), 2526 m and 2541 m (limestone in the Jorsalfare Formation). The reservoir of the Brent Group was expected to comprise a complete set of formations. However, only the Ness and Oseberg Formations were conclusively present. The absence of the Tarbert Formation is due to erosion. From the image log (FMI), a fault zone was recognized within the Brent Group in the interval between 3900 m and 3909 m. The absence of the Etive/Rannoch Formations (and possibly, the upper part of the Oseberg Formation) is due to faulting. It is possible that the uppermost 3 m of the 19 m thick lower sand (from 3904 to 3907 m) in the reservoir represents the Etive Formation. However, this is not conclusive and the sands are thus assigned to the Oseberg Formation in this report.


The uppermost sandstone layer in the Ness Formation, from 3815 m to 3819 m, contained gas/condensate. This was confirmed by MDT sampling. The remaining sandstones in Ness/Oseberg Formations were water wet. MDT fluid sampling gave water in the Oseberg Formation (3909.3 m), water in the Ness Formation (3838.5 m), and gas/condensate in the Ness Formation (3816.0 m). One core was cut from 3899 m in the Ness Formation. The core jammed after 1 m. 30/3-9 was permanently abandoned on July 1 2000 as a gas/condensate discovery.

Well: 30/3-10 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 30/3-10 S is located in the Northern North Sea at the eastern flank of the Central Viking Graben, SE of the Huldra Field. The 30/3-10 S well was the second well to be drilled on the Canon structure. The Discovery well 30/3-9 was the first. The main objective of the well was to appraise hydrocarbons within the Brent Group of Jurassic age and prove additional hydrocarbons in the Statfjord Formation of Jurassic-Triassic age. Further objectives were to verify reservoir properties, fluid contacts, and fluid properties and to test up flank erosion of the Brent Group. Planned TD was 50 m into the Lunde Formation of the Triassic prognosed at 4298 m TVD RKB.
                


Operations and results


Appraisal well 30/3-10 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation West Alpha on 14 February 2009 and drilled to TD at 4168 m in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation. No overpressured shallow gas was observed by the ROV at the wellhead or by the MWD while drilling the 36" and the 26" holes. The well was drilled vertical down to 2850 m before deviation was initiated. It was drilled with Spud mud down to 1412 m, with Versatec OBM from 1412 m to 3672 m, and with Versatherm OBM from 3672 m to TD.


The well penetrated rocks of Quaternary, Tertiary, Cretaceous, and Jurassic age. The top Brent Group was encountered at 3737 m, 75 m TVD shallow compared to the prognosis. It was 12 m TVD thick only and consisted of Ness Formation only. The top Statfjord Formation was penetrated approximately 224 m shallower than prognosis. The Brent Group proved as expected gas with a fluid gradient of 0.29 bar/m. No gas/water contact was observed. The Statfjord Formation proved to be water bearing.
                


High gas readings with peaks above 20% were recorded below 1800 m, with the highest levels seen in the Late Cretaceous Jorsalfare Formation. The lithology associated with the gas peaks was typically claystones with stringers of limestone/possible sandstones. No visible oil shows above the OBM were reported from the well.


No cores were cut. MDT fluid samples were collected in the Ness Formation at 3741.7 m, at 3749.65 m, and at 3754.88 m. The Quicksilver probe (PQ) was used for the sampling. The well was permanently abandoned on 29 April 2009 as a gas/condensate appraisal well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 30/6-11
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 30/6-11 was drilled on the Delta structure on the Flatfisk Slope, close to the northwestern end of the Oseberg Fault Block in the North Sea. The primary objective was to find hydrocarbon accumulations in the Brent Group. Secondary objective was to find additional hydrocarbon accumulations within the Early Jurassic Cook Formation and Statfjord Group. The well was placed in an area where a complete Jurassic succession could be expected. Planned TD was 75 m into the Statfjord Group.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 30/6-11 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Nortrym on 20 December 1982 and drilled to TD at 4001 m in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Group. When running casing in the 17 1/2" section at 2165 m the rig had to wait on weather. Cavings accumulated as fill on the bottom and the casing was differentially stuck. Various additives were used to free the casing, including diesel. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 235 m, with pre-hydrated bentonite and seawater from 235 m to 965 m, and with KCl/polymer mud from 965 m to 2165 m. From 2165 m to 3654 m, the KCl/polymer mud was slowly converted to a dispersed lignosulphonate/lignite mud and in the bottom 8 3/8" section, from 3654 m to TD a dispersed lignosulphonate/lignite mud system was used. From 2165 and downwards the diesel content in the mud was 5%, diminishing to traces below 3265 m.


The Brent Group (3351 - 3561m) had a gross thickness of 210 m with 118 m of net sand, giving a net to gross ratio of 0.56. The average porosity of the sandstones were calculated from wireline logs to 16% with an average water saturation of 80%. The Cook Formation (3752.5 - 3768.5m) had a net sand thickness of 3 m, giving a net to gross ratio of 0,19. The average porosity of the sandstones were calculated from wireline logs to 14% with an average water saturation of 55%. The Statfjord Group (3892.5 - 4001 m) had 85 m calculated as net sand giving a net to gross ratio of 0.86. The average porosity was calculated from logs to 11% with a water saturation varying from 60-100%.
                


Oil shows from both cuttings and cores together with high resistivity readings from the logs stated the presence of hydrocarbons in sandstones from the Brent Group, Cook Formation and in the very top of the Statfjord Group. All hydrocarbons were evaluated as residual. Drill stem testing and FMT sampling of the Brent Group produced no hydrocarbons. Otherwise, oil shows were described on limestone stringers in the interval 2515 m to 2635 m and on siltstones in the Late Jurassic between 3265 and 3320 m.


Seven cores were cut in this well, one in the Late Jurassic, 5 in the Etive Formation and one in the Cook Formation sandstones. An FMT fluid sample was taken at 3463.5 m. It recovered mud filtrate and water only.


The well was permanently abandoned on 30 March 1983 as dry with shows.


Testing




A drill stem test was performed from the interval 3448.5 to 3454.5 m. The test gave no flow to surface and no samples of formation fluid could be recovered from the test string.

Well: 30/6-19
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 30/6-19 was drilled on the Beta Saddle prospect between the Veslefrikk field and the 30/6-5 Oseberg East (Beta South) discovery. The objectives of the well were to prove hydrocarbons in the Brent Group, the Cook Formation, and the Statfjord Group. Planned TD was ca 3400 m or ca 100 m into the Statfjord Formation.


Operations and results


Well 30/6-19 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Polar Pioneer on 9 April 1986 and drilled to TD at 3301 m in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Group, Eirikson Formation. Drilling proceeded without significant problems down to 1589 m where the string got stuck and the well was sidetracked at 1179 m. At 3117 m the string got stuck and a cement plug was set at 2847 m. The well was sidetracked again at 2822 m and drilled to TD.


The Brent Group (2857 - 2989 m) contained oil down to the OWC at 2956.5 m (Free water level from RFT). Net pay in the oil zone is 58.1 m with an average porosity of 18.8% and an average water saturation of 48.3%. No additional hydrocarbon reservoirs were encountered by the well and only occasional weak shows were seen on sandstone stringers in the Drake Formation and single grains in the Statfjord Group. RFT pressures showed the Cook Formation to be overpressured and the Statfjord Group to be underpressured relative to the Brent Group. This assumes same water density as in the Brent Group water zone.
                


Four conventional cores were cut in the Brent reservoir from 2858 - 2970 m. Core depths are ca 1.5 m shallower than logger's depth. RFT pressure recordings were performed throughout the Brent Group and in the Cook and Statfjord Formations. Segregated RFT samples were taken in the final sidetrack in the Ness Formation (2869 m; water and a little oil), the Etive Formation (2909 m; oil), and in the Oseberg Formation (2954.8 m water and a little oil).
                


The well was suspended 21 June 1986 for further testing at a later time. It is classified as an oil and gas discovery.


Testing




Three drill stem tests were performed.
                


DST 1 tested the interval 2945-2954.0 in the Lower Oseberg Formation. It produced 564 Sm3 oil and 26000 Sm3 gas through a 40/64" choke. GOR was 46 Sm3/Sm3. Oil density was 0.864 g/cm3 and associated gas was 0.85 (air = 1) with 5% CO2 and 3.5 ppm H2S. Bottom hole temperature in the test was 124 deg C.


DST 2 tested the interval 2907 - 2932.3 m in the Upper Oseberg, Rannoch and Etive Formations. It produced 797 Sm3 oil and 34000 Sm3 gas through a 36/64" choke. GOR was 43 Sm3/Sm3. Oil density was 0.833 g/cm3 and associated gas was 0.78 (air = 1) with 5% CO2 and 4 ppm H2S. Bottom hole temperature in the test was 122 deg C.


DST 3 tested the interval 2876-2884 m in the Ness Formation. It produced 668 Sm3 oil and 25000 Sm3 gas through a 52/64" choke. GOR was 50 Sm3/Sm3. Oil density was 0.831 g/cm3 and associated gas was 0.86 (air = 1) with 4.5% CO2 and 5 ppm H2S. Bottom hole temperature in the test was 123 deg C.

Well: 30/6-22
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 30/6-22 was drilled on the 30/6-19 Beta Saddle Discovery between the Veslefrikk field and the 30/6-5 Oseberg East (Beta South) discovery. The discovery well 30/6-19 found oil in the Brent Group. The objectives of well 30/6-22 were to narrow the range in the oil/water contact levels in the Tarbert/Ness and the Etive/Rannoch/Oseberg Formations and to get information about lateral variation in reservoir quality.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 30/6 22 was spudded 21 May 1988 by Polar Frontier Drilling semi submersible rig Polar Pioneer and drilled to TD at 3336 m in the Late Jurassic Statfjord Group. Drilling went without problems, but the prospect was intersected 50 m away from where it was decided, in north-eastern direction. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 963 m and with KCl/polymer mud from 963 m to TD.


Top Brent Group, Tarbert Formation was penetrated at 2874 m. Moveable oil was confirmed by logs, RFT pressure gradients and tests in sandstones in the Ness and Etive formations from 2908 m (2880 m TVD MSL). The OWC was not clearly defined, but indicated from RFT pressure gradients to be at 2935 m (2907 m TVD MSL). The Oseberg Formation was water bearing. The Cook Formation had good oil shows but it was tight and impossible to test. No shows were recorded in the Statfjord Formation.


Six cores were cut in the well: The Brent Group was cored in five cores in the interval 2854 - 3009.9 m and one core was cut in the Cook Formation in the interval 3122.5 - 3150.4 m. RFT-tests indicated oil from 2910 m (Ness Formation) and mud filtrate from 2934 m (Etive Formation).


The well was suspended on 13 July as an oil appraisal.


Testing




Two DST tests were performed.
                


DST 1 tested the interval 2917.2 - 2936.2 m in the Etive Formation. It produced 294 Sm3 oil and 19430 Sm3 gas /day through a 32/64" choke. The GOR was 67 Sm3/Sm3, the oil density was 0.892 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was 0.76 (air = 1) with no measurable H2S and 4 % CO2. The maximum flowing bottom hole temperature measured at sensor point 2852.8 m was 122.9 deg C.


DST 2 tested the interval 2908.8 - 2912.3 m in the Ness Formation. It produced 480 Sm3 oil and 31680 Sm3 gas /day through a 32/64" choke. The GOR was 66 Sm3/Sm3, the oil density was 0.823 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was 0.765 (air = 1) with no measurable H2S and 4 % CO2. The maximum flowing bottom hole temperature measured at sensor point 2854.2 m was 123.7 deg C.

Well: 30/6-24 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 30/6-24 S was drilled on the Delta Structure, some 5 km north of the main Oseberg Field area. The primary objective was to test the hydrocarbon potential of the Statfjord Formation.


Operations and results


Wildcat well was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Vildkat Explorer on 13 October 1991 and drilled to TD at 3986 m (3742 m TVD). The well was offset from the target location and deviated below 1035 m due to the proximity of a 30" gas pipeline above the target co-ordinates. An 8 1/2" pilot hole was drilled from 231 m to 422 m to check for shallow gas, but no shallow gas was found. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 1017 m, with KCl mud from 1017 m to 3300 m, and with Thermadril WBM mud from 3300 m to TD. When running the 9 5/8" casing it stuck at 3052 m. A spot of 25 m3 EZ spot/diesel was added to free the casing and this oil was in the mud down to 3974 m.


An oil show was recorded on cuttings from a limestone stringer at 2505 m. Top Jurassic, Dunlin Group came in at 3581 m. Dunlin Group had sporadic weak shows on siltstone cuttings. Top of target reservoir Statfjord Group was encountered at 3683 m. It was water bearing with oil shows on core no 1 in a 2-meter zone from 3686 m to 3688 m. Otherwise no hydrocarbon indications were recorded in the well.


Two cores were cut in the top of the Statfjord Group from 3682 m to 3712 m. No wire line fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 6 December 1991 as a dry well with shows.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 30/6-30
Wellbore history
 





Wildcat well 30/6-30 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Transocean Arctic on 18 October 2018. A 9 7/8” pilot hole was drilled from 209 through the Utsira sand and down to 1000 m. No shallow gas or water flow was reported. The well was drilled to TD at 3493 m in the Early Jurassic Drake Formation. Operations proceeded without significant problems. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 1000 m and with oil-based mud from 1000 m to TD.


The Ness Formation was penetrated from 3260 to 3336 m. The Ness Formation consists of interbedded sands, shales and coals, and the reservoir quality was better than prognosed with higher net to gross and thicker individual sand units. Ness proved to be hydrocarbon bearing in three sand units. Each sand exhibits hydrocarbons in down-to situations and pressure data demonstrate that the three hydrocarbon bearing sands are not in pressure communication with each other.  Seventeen metres of net hydrocarbon pay was found within the gross 56 metre column. The primary Oseberg Formation target was water bearing as indicated by logs and proven by a water sample in the Oseberg at 3363 m. The Oseberg Formation is 86 metres thick with very good reservoir properties. The overlying Etive Formation also has very good reservoir quality and was proven to be in pressure communication with the Oseberg. The Etive Formation had good oil shows in sandstones with stain, strong petroleum odour, direct and cut fluorescence and strong residual ring. The underlying Rannoch had weaker shows in sandstones with no stain or odour, but with direct and cut fluorescence and weak residual ring.


Four cores were cut in the interval 3278 to 3494.48 m (TD) with 100% recovery. MDT samples were taken at 3313.49 m (gas), 3325.6 m (gas) and 3362.61 m (water).


The well was permanently abandoned on 18 November 2018 as a gas/condensate discovery.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 31/1-1
Wellbore history
 





General


Wildcat well 31/1-1 was drilled on the Bjørn prospect ca 10 km due west of the Troll West oil province. The primary target was the fluvial-deltaic Middle Jurassic Brent Group. Secondary targets were the underlying Lower Jurassic Cook and Statfjord Formations. Planned TD was 2977 m, or 100 m into the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation.


Operations and results


The rig came on cost on the 22nd of December 2007. Prior to spud, 8 days were spent waiting on weather to set anchors. Well 31/1-1 was spudded on 2 January 2008 by the semi-submersible rig Bredford Dolphin. The well was drilled vertically to a TD at 2920m in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation. It was drilled with seawater down to 546 m, with KCl/glycol mud from 546 m to 1219 m, and with Performadril mud from 1219 m to TD.


Reservoir quality sands were encountered in the 3 targets zones but all were water bearing. Weak shows were recorded at 2414 to 2449 m in siltstone/sandstone of theTarbert Formation, and at 2514 to 2564 m in sandstone of the Etive Formation.


No cores were cut and no wire line fluid samples were taken.
                


The well was permanently abandoned on 15 February 2008 as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 31/2-1
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/2-1 is the Troll West gas and oil Discovery well. The purpose of the well was to establish the basic stratigraphy in the area, and to evaluate the prospectivity of the Jurassic sequence. The structure is formed by a tilted Jurassic fault block on the Sogn Spur High between the North Viking Graben and the Horda Basin. A migration path from the Viking Graben kitchen area is provided by monoclinal fault blocks. The most dominant characteristic of the structure was the presence of a "flatspot", which was believed to be associated with a present hydrocarbon/water contact. Sealing of the potential Jurassic reservoir is provided by Cretaceous and Paleocene Claystones, overlying the reservoir sandstones.





The well is Type Well for the Johansen, Krossfjord, Fensfjord, and the Sognefjord Formations, and Reference Well for the Amundsen, Cook, and Drake Formations.





Operations and results


Wildcat well 31/2-1 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Borgny Dolphin on 17 July 1979 and drilled to TD at 2433 m in the Late Triassic Hegre Group. Severe problems with setting the 30" casing led to abandoning of the first hole and re-spudding on 24 July, 50 m to the south of the original spud position. The well was drilled with gel polymer down to 793 m, and with gypsum/lignosulphonate mud from 793 m to TD.


The well 31/2-1 proved the existence of a Late - Middle Jurassic gas bearing reservoir sequence in the Flathead A structure (block 31/2). A gross commercial gas column of 134.5 metres with top at 1439.5 m was encountered in good-moderate quality coastal - shallow marine sands. Good oil shows with oil bleeding from cores were encountered from 1567 m to 1597 m, below the gas. It is possible that both a gas-oil contact and an oil-water contact occur in this zone, however, data available suggested tight formation. From the pressure data the plausible interpretation is that a gas-water contact effectively exists at the intersection of the extrapolated gas and water pressure gradients at 1574 m (1550 m SS), which would imply that the oil observed in cores is actually residual. Indications of oil occurred down to 1622 m. The well results showed that the marked seismic flatspot seen on seismic lines across the structure at 1685 msec was closely related to the base of the gas column. For a detailed evaluation of the reservoir it was decided to take diamond bit cores over the whole hydrocarbon bearing Jurassic interval. A total of 18 cores were cut in the interval from 1450 to 1668 m, with a recovery length of 182 m (86%). The cored interval extends from just below the top reservoir to below the hydrocarbon/water contact. Extensive RFT pressure measurements showed the accumulation to be under hydrostatic conditions. Good RFT gas samples were recovered from 1442 m, 1468 m, 1482 m, 1515 m, 1547.5 m, 1573 m, and 1574 m. They showed a consistent dry gas composition with 93% methane, 0.5% CO2, and 1.5% N2. Only trace C4+ and no H2S was recorded. A number of RFT water samples were found to be heavily contaminated by the mud and not representative for the Formation.
                


The well was suspended on 9 November for re-entry and possible testing at a later stage.


Testing


After RFT testing preparations were made for drill stem testing of the interval where oil had been observed bleeding from cores (1565 to 1622 m). Due to severe weather and technical problems the test was aborted.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 31/2-2
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/2-2 was drilled some 4 km east of the discovery well 31/2-1 on seismic line 79-416 at SP 200. The concession requirement for the wells were complete penetration of the prospective Jurassic sequence and terminate in Triassic or older. The particular objectives of well 31/2-2 were: to evaluate lateral variation of reservoir parameters eastwards on the flank of the structure: to test the zone of oil shows seen in 31/2-1 in better reservoir conditions, to test the gas accumulation in a down-dip location: to evaluate the nature of the seismic flatspot, and to provide geological calibration of seismic reflectors above the reservoir for improved regional evaluation.


Operations and results


Well was spudded with the semi-submersible installation West Venture on 27 February 1980 and drilled to TD at 1857 m in the Middle Jurassic Krossfjord Formation. The 36" hole was drilled without incident to 433 m using seawater with viscous pills spotted on connections. From 422 m to 433 m hard drilling was experienced. This was interpreted as a boulder bed similar to that found at a comparable depth in the previous 31/2-1 well. Problems were encountered with the stability of the temporary guide base, and the well had to be abandoned. The rig was moved NE 25 m and re-spudded on 29 February. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 800 m, and with gypsum/lignosulphonate mud from 800 m to TD.
                


Top reservoir (Sognefjord Formation) came in at 1544 m and was gas bearing down to a gas/oil contact at 1579 m, and oil-bearing from 1579 m down to an oil/water contact at 1591 m. Both contacts were clearly defined on logs, the gas/oil contact was confirmed by RFT pressure gradients, and moveable oil was confirmed by RFT sampling at 1587.5 m and 1590 m. Gas samples were obtained from 1548 m and 1571 m. Weak oil shows began at 1561 m in the gas zone, strong shows with stained and bleeding cores and a paraffinic smell were observed in the oil zone. Oil shows ceased at 1602 m.


Coring started at 1515 m in the Draupne Formation and terminated below the oil-water contact. A 120 m interval was cored with 94.2 m of core in 13 cores recovered at surface.
                


After coring and logging of the Late Jurassic sandstones the well was suspended at the 9 5/8 casing shoe and the rig towed to Bergen for inspection and repairs on 22 April 1980.
                


Testing


No drill stem test was performed
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 31/2-3
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/2-3 was drilled in the Troll West area, approximately 8 km NNE of the Troll Discovery well 31/2-1. The well was drilled to appraise the Troll Discovery. It should evaluate reservoir parameters along the axis of maximum gross hydrocarbon column; prove maximum hydrocarbon reserves in the major northern fault block; confirm the significance of the seismic flatspot as a direct hydrocarbon indicator; further assess the significance of the oil shows found in 31/2-1; and evaluate the influence of earlier Kimmerian fault movements on reservoir characteristics.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 31/2-3 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Borgny Dolphin on 28 March and drilled to TD at 2601 m in Late Triassic sediments in the Statfjord Formation. Drilling took 115 days. The reason for the long drilling period was safety inspection of the rig as a result of the "Alexander Kielland" accident and a strike amongst the Norwegian rig crew. The well was drilled with bentonite and seawater down to 816 m and with a gypsum/lignosulphonate mud from 816 m to TD.


No potential reservoir zones were encountered above top Jurassic. The well confirmed that the Late Jurassic sandstone reservoir encountered in wells 31/2-1 and 2 was well developed also in this more northerly part of the structure. A gross gas column of 189 m was penetrated with top at 1384 m. The uppermost 120 m was in a good clean sand (Sognefjord Formation) while the lower part of the gas column was in a micaceous and poor reservoir sand (Heather and Fensfjord Formations). Below the gas a 12 m thick oil zone was encountered, the same thickness and at the same level as in well 31/2-2. In this well however, the oil was in a very micaceous and poorly developed reservoir. The reservoir was uncomformably overlain by Palaeocene claystones, which thus act as an effective seal for the reservoir. Below the OWC at 1585 no moveable hydrocarbons were seen in the well, but shows continued down to 1612 m and isolated shows were seen at 1630 m and at 1638 m.
                


The seismic Flatspot did coincide with the base of the gas column in well 31/2-3, supporting that the Flatspot indeed is a direct hydrocarbon indicator over the entire prospect.
                


Coring was performed in the Middle to Late Jurassic interval from 1412 m to 1645.5 m. Twenty-one cores with a total recovery of 194.4 m (84%) were cut. Coring started approximately 28 m below the top reservoir and continued well below the hydrocarbon/water contact. Prior to the full scale production test programme, a series of runs were made with the Schlumberger Repeat Formation Tester (RFT). A total of 10 RFT runs were made. The first run indicated pressure gradients very similar to those obtained in Wells 31/2-1 and 31/2-2. It was, however, impossible to confirm the 12-meter oil gradient indicated by RFT's in well 31/2-2. Sampling attempts in the water zone failed as only mud filtrate was recovered. In the suspected oil zone, no samples were obtained in spite of numerous attempts as the tool probe always plugged in the relatively tight and poorly consolidated formation. Only two gas samples were obtained, at 1458 m and 1568.5 m.


The well was permanently abandoned on 20 July 1980 as a gas and oil appraisal well.
                


Testing


Four Production Tests were conducted in the Middle to Late Jurassic. PT1 tested the interval 1600.5 m to 1605.5 m in the water zone, PT2 tested the interval 1577.5 m to 1582.5 m in the oil zone, PT3 tested the interval 1520 m to 1535 m in the micaceous part of the gas bearing section, and PT4 tested 1435 m to 1460 m in the top clean sand of the gas section.


After the bottom hole test valve was opened for the test in the water zone, the well flowed for 17 minutes until it died. Some 87.5 litres of formation water (70.000 ppm NaCl equivalent) were recovered.


In the oil zone test (PT2) the well came in at a low rate and flowed at about 4.5 - 6.6 Sm3/day for four days. The oil was about 24 deg API and the GOR around 36 Sm3/Sm3. The micaceous gas zone test (PT3) stabilized at a rate of about 142000 Sm3/day on 28/64" choke during the clean up period. The produced fluids were gas of gravity 0.617 (air = 1) and condensate of 50.3 API, with some water (mostly brine) and traces of sediment. The gas contained no detectable H2S and approximately 0.4% C02. Sequential rate tests followed where the rates continuously improved up to 923000 Sm3/day. The test was terminated while production rates were still increasing. The reason for the increasing rates was assumed to be development of a channel behind the casing creating communication with the better sand some 10 meters above the top of the perforations. The clean sand gas test was performed with a gravel pack completion. Severe turbulence effects dominated it. After the initial clean up at 368000 - 481000 Sm3/day flow rate, the well produced at maximum rate of about 1133000 Sm3/day. The fluids had similar composition as in PT3.


Temperatures measured during the test gave a formation temperature of 60 - 62 deg C in the gas-bearing section of the reservoir. This corresponds to a linear temperature gradient from seafloor to top reservoir of ca 50 deg C, which is very high for the area.

Well: 31/2-4
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/2-4 is located some 10 km NNW of the discovery well 31/2-1 in a separate fault compartment near the crest of the Jurassic gas accumulation. This crestal area appeared also to coincide with the culminations of all deeper horizons that could be mapped. The well had two main objectives. The first was to appraise the Jurassic gas accumulation in the 31/2-1 Troll Discovery in a location with nearly maximum gross hydrocarbon column. The well should test lateral variations in this reservoir. The second major objective was to explore deeper Triassic/Palaeozoic Formations. The well would test possible hydrocarbon accumulations under the Late Jurassic Troll reservoir, explore possible pre-Jurassic source rocks, and provide geological ages for deep horizons and thus improve the regional geological setting.
                


TD of the well was proposed to be 5000 m below sea level or in Palaeozoic formations whatever came first.


Operations and results


Well 31/2-4 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Borgny Dolphin on 1 September 1980 and drilled to TD at 815 m in the Hordaland Group. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills. After having set the 20" casing, the well was secured and suspended on September 13 due to a farm out of the rig to Statoil. Statoil had requested the Borgny Dolphin to be released to secure their well 34/10-10, which was blowing gas from a shallow gas zone.
                


The well was classified as a dry well.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed in the well.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 31/2-5
Wellbore history
 





General


Wildcat well 31/2-5 is located in the southern part of the oil province in the Troll West area, some 6 km west of the discovery well 31/2-1, in a downthrown fault block. The objectives of the well were to test presence and nature of hydrocarbons in a structure west of the main gas reservoir; to test lateral variation in reservoir characteristics westwards; to investigate possible causes for the difference in flat spot appearance in this fault block; and to get a good geologic identification of the various seismic reflectors for lateral extrapolation of well data.
                


Operations and results


Problems were experienced during positioning and anchoring of semi-submersible installation West Venture for the wildcat well 31/2-5. After 6 days efforts the installation had to be repositioned 25 m from the intended location and the anchors were successfully laid out and tensioned. The well was spudded on 26 October 1980 and drilled to TD at 2532 m in the Triassic Hegre Group. The well was drilled with seawater and viscous pills down to 443 m, with gelled seawater from 443 m to 810 m, with KCl/polymer mud from 810 m to 1807 m, and with seawater/gel from 1807 m to TD.


Well 31/2-5 confirmed that the Late Jurassic Sognefjord Formation sandstone reservoir was well developed also in the western part of the structure. A gas column was penetrated from 1536 m to 1579 m (43 m), followed by a 21 m thick oil column down to an OWC at 1600 m. Good oil shows continued down to 1644.5 m. The GOC was found at the same depth as seen in the other wells in the area. The most interesting observation in this well was the presence of the thick oil column below the gas, some 9 m thicker than seen in any of the other wells, and the oil was encountered in a section of the reservoir with very good clean sand. It is yet too early to explain the difference in oil thickness, and the importance of a thicker oil column in a good sand will remain unknown until a full production test of the oil has been carried out. A few carbonate cemented, apparently field-wide bands occur with very low poroperm values. A seal over the structure is provided by the Paleocene claystones.


A total of 21 cores (125.8 m) were cut using five Christensen core heads with a total recovery of 98.51 m (78%) from 1511.7 - 1652 m. RFT sampling of pressure points and two successful fluid samples (gas at 1578 m and oil/gas at 1597 m) were consistent with the fluid contacts assessed from the electrical logs. The oil sampled from 1597 m had a gravity of 30.5 deg API compared to 25 deg API in other 31/2 wells.


The well was plugged from 1204 m to 1465 m and suspended on 21 December 1980 as an oil and gas appraisal well.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 31/2-6
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/2-6 is located in a fault block north-east on the main Troll structure, approximately 8 km NNE of 31/2-3. The main objective of the well was to test the north-eastern margin of the Troll structure and to prove hydrocarbon communication between block 31/2 and 31/3. The well location was picked to test the oil zone in a good sand reservoir. A second objective was to get reliable geologic tie to the seismic reflectors to allow for accurate lateral extrapolation of well data. Planned TD was 2500 m in Triassic sediments.
                


The well is Reference Well for the Sele Formation.





Operations and results


Appraisal well 31/2-6 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Borgny Dolphin on and drilled to TD at 1760 m in the Late Jurassic Formation. The 9 5/8" casing collapsed at 771 m and was cut and retrieved from 760 m. As a result of this, well 31/2-6 was not deepened to the Triassic. The well was drilled with seawater gel down to 614 m and with KCl polymer mud from 614 m to TD.


Well 31/2-6 proved a similar hydrocarbon accumulation in this northern fault block area to that of the main field accumulation tested by wells 31/2-1,2,3 and 4. The well encountered the Sognefjord Formation at 1492 m. The Formation held a 79.4 m gross gas column underlain by a 10.3 m oil column. The GOC at 1571.4 m and the OWC was at 1582.2 m. Well 31/2-6 confirmed the overall interpretation of the flatspot as a direct hydrocarbon indicator. Oils shows were recorded on cores from 1504 m to 1601 m. In addition, cuttings gave patchy shows in the interval from 1710 m to 1758 m. Sidewall cores from this interval did not confirm shows in the latter interval.


Coring commenced at 1504.4 m and terminated at 1632.05 m, within the Sognefjord Formation. Thus 127.65 m of core was cut from which 123.65 m (97%) was recovered. An RFT gas sample was taken at 1518 m as a backup until samples could be obtained from the subsequent production test. No sample was attempted in the oil zone because of the badly washed out hole.


The well was permanently abandoned on 17 October 1981 as a gas and oil appraisal.





Testing


Production testing was carried out in both the oil and gas zones. The oil zone from 1576 m to 1579 m produced up to 151 Sm3 bbl/day of 27 °API oil with a GOR of up to 267 Sm3/Sm3. Maximum temperature recorded was 65.6 deg. C. The gas zone from 1518 m to 1537 m produced up to 1699000 Sm3 gas/day with a condensate/gas ratio of ca 0.00002 Sm3/Sm3 (GOR = ca 50000 Sm3/Sm3). The maximum recorded temperature in this test was 62.8 deg. C. The DST temperatures gives a temperature gradient above the Troll reservoir of ca 51 deg C /km, which is unusually high compared to the average for the Norwegian continental shelf.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 31/2-7
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/2-7 was drilled in the Troll West oil province in the Northern North Sea. The primary objective was to appraise the oil accumulation in the area west of well 31/2-4 in the Troll Field.
                


Operations and results


Well 31/2-7 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Borgny Dolphin on 22 April 1982 and drilled to TD at 1660 m in the Late Jurassic Heather Formation. No significant problems were encountered during operations. Tight spots were encountered in the 17 1/2" section. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 455, with seawater/gel/CMC/Drispac from 455 m to 825 m, with KCl/polymer mud from 825 m to 1517 m, and with KCl/polymer/gel/lingo mud from 1517 m to TD.


The well penetrated 11 m f Late Jurassic Draupne shale at 1535 m before entering the Sognefjord Formation reservoir sands at 1546 m. The Heather Formation was encountered at 1601 m. The Sognefjord Formation was hydrocarbon bearing with a 20.5 m gas column from 1545.5 - 1566 m and a 27.5 m oil column from 1566 to 1593.5 m. The gas reservoir consisted of alternating micaceous, bioturbated fine to medium grained sandstones and cross laminated, massive fine to coarse grained sandstones. The upper part of the oil reservoir (down to 1586 m) was of the same quality as the gas reservoir. Below 1586 m the sandstones were very fine to medium grained with high mica content. Weak shows (fluorescence and cut) were recorded on cores down to 1635 m.


Six fibreglass sleeve cores were taken from 1547.0 m to 1635.0 m in the 8 1/2" section. Thus 88 m of core were cut of which 72.25 m (82%) was recovered. In order to verify the higher than expected GOC several unsuccessful (due to probe plugging) attempts were made to obtain RFT fluid samples at around 1570 m. Eventually one of the RFT chambers was filled at 1568 m. After a few more attempts the other chamber was filled at 1566.5 m. At surface the contents of both chambers were checked and found to be 29 API oil. This proved a 27.5 m oil column in the well and thus the existence of oil above 1547 m SS (1572 m), which had been interpreted as the GOC in all previous wells.
                


The well was permanently abandoned on 14 June 1982 as an oil and gas appraisal.


Testing


The well was gravel packed and acidized before testing. A production test was carried out over the external gravel packed interval 1584 - 1590.5 m. The objectives were to investigate inflow performance and sand control, obtain representative fluid samples for PVT analyses, and to evaluate well coning performance. At maximum rate in the 92 hour long main flow the well flowed 1113 Sm3 oil/day on a 180/64" choke. The GOR was between 53 and 45 Sm3/Sm3, the oil density was 0.89 g/cm3 (27.5 deg API), and the gas gravity was 0.640. Maximum down-hole temperature recorded was 67.8 deg C.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 31/2-8
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/2-8 was drilled in the northern part of block 31/2, some 3 km NW of the Troll Field boundary, to test a downthrown Jurassic fault-block outside the Troll Field. The primary objective was the Late Jurassic, shallow marine sands of the Viking Group, especially the Sognefjord Formation. The Early Jurassic was secondary objective and would be evaluated by drilling into Triassic sediments.
                


Operations and results


Wildcat well 31/2-8 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Borgny Dolphin on 16 June 1982 and drilled to TD at 3375 m in the Triassic Hegre Group. A gas zone (confirmed by logs) between 510 - 530 m did not cause any problems during drilling of the 14 3/4" pilot hole. Maximum gas reading through this zone was 10 %. The hole was drilled to 840 m and under-reamed to 26" without incident. The 17 1/2" section was drilled first by an 8 1/2" pilot hole down to 1063 m to provide better control when drilling through a potential gas charged fault plane. No indications of gas were seen. 3 cores were taken in the 12 1/4" section. Two washouts occurred when drilling the 8 1/2" hole below 3317 m. The well was drilled with seawater gel down to 840 m, with KCl/polymer from 840 m to 1745 m, with seawater and Drispac from 1745 m to 2743 m and wit Drispac/lignosulphonate from 2743 m to TD.


Only 13 m of Shetland Group chalk was found on top of the Kimmerian unconformity at 1821 m. The Viking Group contained a 15.5 m thick Draupne shale on top of a 680 m thick sequence of sandstone units interbedded in the Heather Formation. The Middle to Early Jurassic was also well developed. Shows occurred sporadically in limestones, siltstone, and claystones through the Early Tertiary and Late Cretaceous. When entering into the Late Jurassic reservoir sands at 1836.5 m (Sognefjord Formation) ditch gas readings went up to more than 4% from a background lower than 1%, but without oil indications in the uppermost section. On the cores taken, very good oil shows were observed in the coarser grained, clean sands between 1841.8 m and 1854.8 m. In the carbonate-cemented band down to 1856.6 m, direct fluorescence became patchy. In the deeper, very fine to fine, micaceous sands the quality of the shows deteriorated further until they disappeared completely around 1872 m. Below the Sognefjord Formation, the only shows encountered was in a sidewall sample at 3050.5 m (at the top of the Statfjord Formation). From log analysis the Jurassic sands were interpreted to be oil bearing from 1836.5 m to ca. 1868 m; below this depth no hydrocarbons were seen.
                


Three conventional cores were cut in the interval 1841.8 m to 1888.5 m in the Late Jurassic. One RFT sample at 1849 m recovered 1800 ml mud contaminated formation water and 100 ml of emulsified hydrocarbons.


The well was completed on 18 August 1982 as a well with shows.


Testing


Oil shows on cores and preliminary log interpretation led to a DST in the interval 1843 m to 1848 m in Late Jurassic sandstone. After some technical problems the well was flowed for 2 minutes followed by a one-hour build-up. The well was then flowed until it died after having produced approximately 33 barrels of formation fluid with a trace of oil. A wire line sandballer found 22 m of sand on top of the bridge plug.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 31/2-10
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/2-10 was drilled as an appraisal well in the Troll West oil province in the Northern North Sea. The main objectives were to define the top and intra reservoir markers in this area of the Troll West, establish the extent of the 27.5 m oil column in the area in which the GOC is at 1541 m sub-sea (1567 m RKB), and to determine the reserves potential in the structurally low area east-north of well 31/2-5 and south east of 31/2-7.
                


Operations and results


The site survey revealed, typical for the area, numerous pockmarks. These had a fairly random distribution of 15 to 20 per km2. Although the size of individual pockmarks varied, average sizes were between 30 and 40 m wide at the rim, and 3 to 4 m deep at the centre. At the location itself no pockmark was seen.
                


Well 31/2-10 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Borgny Dolphin on 2 October 1982 and drilled to TD at 1833 m, 40 m into in the Early Jurassic Fensfjord Formation. After drilling the 36" section, a 14 3/4" pilot hole was drilled to 810 m. The hole was then logged without indication of shallow gas before opening up to 26". One and a half days were lost during coring due to bad weather. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 472 m, with gel/seawater from 472 m to 810 m, with KCl/polymer mud from 810 m to 1530 m, and with seawater/Drispac from 130 m to TD.


Top Jurassic was encountered with a 35 m thick Draupne shale. The Sognefjord Formation sands were encountered at 1600 m, below the prognosed OWC. The Heather Formation came in at 1733 m, and the Fensfjord Formation at 1793 m. From top Sognefjord Formation to 1647 m bleeding oil and oil stained grains were noted on the cores. However the petrophysical interpretation concluded the sands to be water bearing.
                


Ten cores were taken in the interval 1575 m to 1741.5 m and 127.98 m (77%) was recovered. All cores were taken in fibreglass sleeves to achieve better recovery in the loose sands. One RFT run was made between 1601.5 and 1817.5 m and confirmed a water gradient. No wire line fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 31 October as a dry well.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 31/2-11
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/2-11 was drilled as an appraisal well in the Troll West oil province in the Northern North Sea. The main objectives were to appraise the reservoir quality and the extension of the 28-m oil column in the southern part of the 31/2-7 accumulation in the Viking Group reservoir sequence. The well would assist in the mapping of the permeability distribution in the oil province, provide an additional data point for the correlation and mapping of the depositional units, and obtain additional oil production test data for input to the field development.
                


Operations and results


Well 31/2-11 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Borgny Dolphin on 17 March 1983 and drilled to TD at 1744 m in the Middle Jurassic Fensfjord Formation. No major problems occurred during drilling. The well was drilled with Seawater and gel down to 810 m, with KCl/polymer mud from 810 m to 1535 m, and with CaCl2/CaCO3/polymer mud from 1535 m to TD.


Top Jurassic, Sognefjord Formation, was encountered at 1558 m. The reservoir sands were found to be hydrocarbon bearing with GOC at 1566 m (1541 m sub-sea) and OWC (50% saturation) at 1593 m (1567 m sub-sea), in-line with the regional contacts in this area of the Troll West Oil Province. Below OWC residual oil was interpreted down to some 1640 m.


A total of eight cores were cut. To enable investigation of the shallow sediments, 2 cores were cut in the interval 380 m to 399 m and one from 475 to 476 m. Five cores were cut in the Late Jurassic reservoir sands from 1555 to 1629 m using fibre glass sleeve techniques to achieve better recovery in the poorly consolidated sands. Attempts to obtain RFT fluid samples were unsuccessful due to plugging of the tool with chalk particles from the mud.


The well was permanently abandoned on 25 May 1983 as an oil and gas appraisal.


Testing


Two DST's were performed, one in the water zone and one in the oil zone. DST 1 tested the interval 1681 to 1685 m in the water zone with the objective of obtaining representative formation water samples. The test produced 20 m3 water before the well died. Representative Formation water samples were obtained. DST 2 in the oil zone was carried out in a clean sand interval between 1571 and 1582 m. It produced at maximum rate on 2x128/64" choke 1248 Sm3 oil with a GOR of 315 Sm3/Sm3. The oil produced had a gravity of 28.6 deg API and the separator gas gravity was 0.66 (air = 1). The gas contained about 2% CO2 and no measurable H2S. No water or gas breakthrough was observed, probably due to tight calcareous streaks above and below the tested interval. The maximum temperature recorded in DST 2 was 68.6 deg C.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 31/2-12
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/2-12 was drilled as an appraisal well in the Troll West oil province in the Northern North Sea. The main objectives were to evaluate various techniques for gas production wells in the Troll field, to establish the reservoir quality in the central part of the Troll field gas accumulation, and to provide additional data point for the correlation and mapping of the depositional units.


Operations and results


Well 31/2-12 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Borgny Dolphin on 26 May 1983 and drilled to TD at 1615 m in the Middle Jurassic Fensfjord Formation. On 4 June, after running the BOP-stack, operations were interrupted by a labour dispute. After the strike ended on 17 June problems with the BOP lead to a further 4 days delay before normal drilling operations were resumed. Some instability problems and well kicks were encountered while drilling and testing in the reservoir. The well was drilled with Seawater and gel down to 807 m, with KCl/polymer mud from 807 m to 1338 m, and with CaCl2/CaCO3/polymer mud from 1338 m to TD.


Top reservoir in well 31/2-12 was encountered at 1365 m. The formations were interpreted to be gas bearing all through the Sognefjord Formation, the Heather Formation (1487 - 1541 m), and down to a clear GOC at 1570.5 m in the Fensfjord Formation. The upper part of the Sognefjord Formation consisted of generally clean sandstones. Below 1455 m the sands were micaceous and silty. Tight calcareous streaks occurred over the whole section. Oil was interpreted from 1570.5 m down to 1581.0 m, where an abrupt drop in resistivity was interpreted as the oil/water contact. The contact was somewhat obscured however by a change in lithology from clean, but rather tight, sandstone to micaceous sandstone. No movable oil was calculated below this depth, but shows (fluorescence and cut) was observed on sidewall cores down to 1608 m.


Ten cores were cut in the Late Jurassic Sognefjord reservoir section. From a total of 89.5 m in the intervals 1366 - 1424 m and 1427 - 1458.5 m 86.7 m core (97%) was recovered. All cores were taken using fibreglass sleeve techniques to achieve better recovery in the poorly consolidated sands. Two gas samples were recovered from the uppermost reservoir section during RFT run 1. Recovery of an oil sample during RFT run 2 failed because of plugging by chalk particles in the mud cake. During a separate run with a modified "long nose" RFT probe an oil sample from the thin oil column at 1576 m was obtained.


The well was permanently abandoned on 9 September 1983 as an oil and gas appraisal well.


Testing


Two intervals in the clean sands were tested. From 1428 to 1452 m the well bore was underreamed to 16 inch and completed with an external gravel pack (E6P). This test (PT1) produced 563700 Sm3 gas/day through a 17.5" choke. A second test (PT-2) used an internal gravel pack (IGP) over the interval from 1385 to 1405 m. During this test the well took a kick and had to be closed in. The production-string was cut and the well killed. After fishing out the production string a successful gravel pack test was performed. This test produced 684100 Sm3 gas/day through a 17.5" choke. The gas produced in the tests was dry (gas gravity = 0.61) with a gas/condensate ratio of 35622 Sm3/Sm3. The condensate produced had a gravity of 51  degAPI. The gas contained 1.5% N2, 0.6% C02 and 0.05 ppm H2S. The maximum down-hole temperatures measured in the two tests were 62.8 and 61.7 deg C in PT1 and PT2, respectively.

Well: 31/2-13 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/2-13 S was drilled as an appraisal in the Troll West oil province in the Northern North Sea. The main objectives of were to investigate the reservoir properties and accumulation conditions between the wells 31/2-5 and 31/2-11. Water and/or gas -coning tests were to be conducted.
                


Operations and results


Appraisal well 31/2-13 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Borgny Dolphin on 2 January 1984 and drilled to TD at 2010 m in the Middle Jurassic Fensfjord Formation. Due to bad weather the string parted and was observed lying across the temporary guide base when the well was spudded. The fish was recovered. Straight hole was drilled down to 500 m where the hole was kicked off with an angle of 1 1/2 degree. Some problems due to tight hole occurred in the 17 1/2" hole. Mud losses to the formation occurred at 1531 and 1700 m, 100 bbls at each depth. A drill break occurred at 1744 m in the 12 1/4" hole section. The well was drilled with seawater and viscous pills down to 473 m, with Gelled mud from 473 m from 473 m to 750 m, with seawater from 750 m to 825 m, and with oil based mud from 825 m to TD. The Oil based mud used was termed "Fazekleen, low toxicity invert oil emulsion mud, based on Shell Sol D70 oil"


Top reservoir (top Sognefjord Formation) was penetrated at 1732 m (1526.5 m TVD), top Heather Formation at 1855 m (1613 m TVD), and top Fensford Formation sandstone at 1934 m (1671 m TVD). Oil and gas were encountered in the Sognefjord Formation. The GOC was at 1790 m (1567 m TVD) and the FWL was estimated at 1828.5 m (1594 m TVD). Strong to moderate fluorescence was observed on the cores down to 1844 m (1606 m TVD), but heavy contamination from the oil-based mud made shows detection somewhat uncertain. The upper half of the oil bearing formation consisted of generally clean sandstones. Below 1555 m TVD the sands were micaceous. Tight calcareous streaks occurred over the whole section. The core permeability in the clean sands ranged from 4 D to 15 D. In the micaceous sands the permeability were from 10 mD to 100 mD.


Eight fibreglass sleeve cores were cut from 1744 to 1844 m in the Sognefjord Formation sands. Seventy metres (70%) were recovered. An RFT segregated fluid sample was taken in the oil zone at 1800 m.


The well was permanently abandoned on 15 March 1984 as a gas and oil appraisal well.


Testing


A Production test was performed through a 5" production tubing in the Late Jurassic sequence. During clean-up producing 810 Sm3 oil/day gas cap gas broke through. The well was then produced at rates up to 604 Sm3/day. The gas-oil ratio increased from solution GOR (57 Sm3/Sm3) to 552 Sm3/Sm3. The produced oil had a gravity 0.88 - 0.89 G7cm3 (28 deg API), the gas 0.70-0.63 (air = 1). No formation water produced. The estimated critical rate (to gas coning) in 31/2-13, ca 315 Sm3/day, was significantly lower than in 31/2-5 (795 Sm3/day). Maximum down-hole temperature recorded in the production test was 65.2 deg C.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 31/2-14
Wellbore history
 





General


Appraisal well 31/2-14 was drilled on the north-western margin of the Troll field. The main objectives of the well were to demonstrate the production potential for oil in the northern part of the Troll oil province, to evaluate the proposed template development scheme and to confirm the predicted extension of high energy progradation sands in the northern region.
                


Operations and results


Well 31/2-14 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Borgny Dolphin on 23 April 1984 and drilled to TD at 1725 m in the Middle Jurassic Fensfjord Formation. The site survey before spud showed, as usual for the area, a seabed with numerous pockmarks (12 pockmarks/km3 on average). After setting the 13 3/8" casing shoe at 1498 m a leak in the kill-line was discovered, leading to repairs of the BOP and replacement of the marine riser. After 10 days lost time normal operations could resume. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 814 m, with KCl/polymer mud from 814 m to 1513 m, and with chalk mud from 1513 m to TD.
                


No sands were encountered above the Jurassic.The well encountered hydrocarbons in the Late Jurassic Sognefjord Formation. Top reservoir was penetrated at 1533 m (1508 m SS). The GOC was at 1566 m (1541 m SS) and the FWL was at 1592 m (1567 m SS). The oil-bearing interval consists of medium to low quality sands with a very clean layer (7m) some 3 m above the OWC. Below 1595 m (top Heather Formation) the sands are micaceous. The core measured permeability values range from 10 mD to 10 Darcy. In the gas bearing part of the cored interval no to weak fluorescence was recorded. In the oil zone (1561 - 1592 m) the fluorescence varied from weak to strong. Below 1594 m no fluorescence was recorded. Seven cores were cut from 1535 m to 1599 m in the Late Jurassic sequence. No samples were taken on wire line.


The well was permanently abandoned on 21 June as a gas and oil appraisal.


Testing


The clean sand interval 1583.3 - 1590.3 m in the oil zone was perforated and completed with an internal gravel. A long duration production test was carried out in an attempt to obtain gas breakthrough. The well was beaned up to 1335 Sm3 oil/day and flowed for 9.5 days. Gas breakthrough did not occur. The oil was a 28.1 deg API gravity oil with a GOR of 60 Sm3/Sm3. Maximum temperature recorded during the test was 68.3 deg. C, which correspond to a temperature gradient of 53 deg C/km above the reservoir.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 31/2-15
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/2-15 was drilled in the northern part of the Troll West oil and gas province to evaluate reservoir quality and development in the northern part of the Troll West accumulation, and to establish fluid contacts in an undrilled fault compartment.
                


Operations and results


Appraisal well 31/2-15 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Borgny Dolphin on 10 September 1984 and drilled to TD at 1677 m in the Middle Jurassic Fensfjord Formation. No major problems were encountered in the operations. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 810 m, with KCl/polymer mud from 810 m to 1460 m, and with chalk mud (calcium chloride/calcium carbonate) from 1460 m to TD.


Top reservoir was encountered at 1482 m as prognosed, but the age of the upper part was found to be of  Paleocene and not Late Jurassic age. The expected Sognefjord Formation came in at 1515 m. The well thus correlate with the situation in well 31/2-18 and 31/2-18 A. Both the Paleocene sand and the Sognefjord Formation sand were gas filled, and the gas continued down to a low permeable micaceous gas/oil transition zone at 1561 m to 1567 m. Testing and sampling proved no mobile oil down to at least 1567 m, and the free oil level was concluded to be very close to the Field-GOC at 1572 m (1547 m SS). The OWC was unambiguously placed at 1583 m, in a highly permeable sand. No shows were recorded above 1482 m or below 1583 m. From petrophysical analysis there were indications of gas saturation in poor quality formation within a 10 m interval below top Fensfjord. However an RFT sample from his interval contained no oil, only gas and brine.


Twelve cores were cut from 1486 m to 1595 m from the lower Paleocene, the Late Jurassic and Sognefjord Formation, and into the Heather Formation. A total of 4 RFT samples were taken. Of these 2 initial failed because of tight formation and seal failure while brine and gas were recovered from the samples at 1637 and 1568 m.


The well was permanently abandoned on 15 November as a gas and oil appraisal.


Testing


Two tests were performed in the Late Jurassic sequence. Test 1 from 1572 m to 1580 m produced oil at rates up to 570 Sm3 /day. The GOR was 54 Sm3/Sm3 and the oil gravity was 28 deg API. Test 2 from 1564 m to 1567 m had the objective to establish hydrocarbon type in the gas/oil transition zone. It gave initially no flow, but after displacing the tubing content partially to nitrogen a small flow of gas was established (10000 m3 gas/day). The gas contained only trace amounts of condensate.

Well: 31/2-16 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/2-16 S was drilled as an appraisal in the Troll-West Oil province in the Northern North Sea. It was located on the crestal part of the Oil Province close to well 31/2-5. The primary objective was to drill hole and prepare for a long term production from a horizontal well drilled 5 m above the oil/water contact in the 23.5 m thick oil column. The length of the horizontal section should preferably be 500 m.
                


Operations and results


Appraisal well 31/2-16 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Bergen on 27 September 1989 and drilled to TD at 2390 m ( 1587 m TVD RKB) in the Late Jurassic Sognefjord Formation. The well was drilled vertical down to 1118 m in the 17 1/2" section and kicked of from there, building angle up to a horizontal well path from ca 1950 m. Problems with tight hole, lost circulation and hard formation (stringers) were encountered repeatedly in the 17 1/2 and 12 1/4" sections from 1015 to 1891 m. The well was drilled with sea water and hi-vis pills down to 1015 m and with Versaport oil based mud from 1015 m to 1891 m, and with a super-saturated NaCl / polymer mud from 1891 m to TD. During well completion and preparation for production testing the screen-packer stuck at 570 m. Close to eight days were lost in milling and retrieving the fish before normal operations could be resumed.
                


The Sognefjord Formation was encountered at 1659 m (1533 m TVD RKB). The established gas/oil contact in the Troll Field is at 1547 m MSL TVD, which is 1.5 m deeper than observed in this well. This 1.5 m is within the uncertainty of the TVD calculations, and a common gas/oil contact is assumed.


No conventional or side wall cores were cut. No wire line pressure tests or fluid samples were taken. Apart from runs 1A, wire line logging was performed by the use of pipe conveyed Logging Systems. MWD was the only deep resistivity measuring device through the whole well.


After drilling to TD the well was completed with 502 m 6 5/8" prepacked screens in the Sognefjord Formation reservoir, from 2390 to 1888 m (1587 - 1586 m RKB TVD). The well was completed on 27 December 1989 as an oil and gas appraisal. It was subsequently reclassified to test production well 31/2-T-16 S. After the test production it was again re-classified to development well 31/2-F-5 H.
                


Testing


A clean-up flow was conducted as part of the 31/2-16 S well completion. During this flow one bottom hole fluid sample and three separator PVT-sets (1 x oil/2 x gas) samples were taken.

Well: 31/2-17 A
Wellbore history
 





General


Well bores 31/2-17 S, -A, and -B were drilled on the north-western periphery of the Troll West gas and oil discovery. The objective was to obtain the thickness of the oil zone and reservoir properties in the "Intermediate Area". Well bores 31/2-17 S and 31/2-17 A are located on each side of a fault subdividing the Intermediate Area into two main compartments. Well 31/2-17 S is located on the eastern side of the fault. The side track 31/2-17 A was turned 180 degrees and landed on the western side of the fault. Well 31/2-17 B was side-tracked from well 31/2-17 A and drilled horizontally to a position about 5 m above the oil water contact.


Operations and results


All three well bores were drilled with the semi-submersible installation Transocean 8 from the same wellhead location. Operations commenced with spud of 31/2-17 S on 28 December 1991 and ended with temporary abandonment of 31/2-17 B on 14 February 1992.
                


Well 31/2-17 S was drilled to TD at 2220 m in the Middle Jurassic Fensfjord Formation. No significant technical problem occurred in the well bore. The well bore was drilled with sea water and hi-vis pills down to 921 m and with KCl/brine/PHPA mud from 921 m to TD. One and a half m of Draupne Formation was penetrated at 1870 m. The Sognefjord Formation reservoir was encountered with gas at 1871.5 m. The Gas-Oil-Contact was penetrated at 1972 m (1544.2 m TVD MSL) and the Oil-Water-Contact was penetrated at 2011 m (1565.8 m TVD MSL), both contacts in the Heather Formation. Six cores were taken. Core one and two and the upper part of core three were cut in the Sognefjord Formation. The rest of the cores were cut in the Heather B Formation. No fluid sample was taken.


Well 31/2-17 A was kicked of from 31/2-17 S at 909 m and drilled to TD at 1924 m in the Middle Jurassic Fensfjord Formation. No significant technical problem occurred. The well bore was drilled with KCl/brine/PHPA mud from kick-off to 1012 m and with oil based mud from 1012 m to TD. Seven m of Draupne Formation was penetrated at 1681.5 m. The Sognefjord Formation reservoir was encountered with gas at 1688.5 m. The Gas-Oil-Contact was penetrated at 1725.4 m (1543.0 m TVD MSL) in the Sognefjord Formation. The Oil-Water-Contact was penetrated at 1746.5 m (1558.1 m TVD MSL) also in the Sognefjord Formation. Five cores were taken. Core one, two, three and the upper part of core four were cut in the Sognefjord Formation. Core no five was cut in the Heater Formation. No fluid sample was taken.


Well 31/2-17 B was kicked off from 31/2-17 A at 1645 m. The well angle was built up to approximately 90 degrees and was drilled to TD at 1838 m after 147 m nearly horizontal drilling in the Sognefjord Formation gas zone. The junk bonnet from the 9 5/8" liner running was accidentally left in the hole and 2 days were spent fishing for it, otherwise no significant technical problem occurred in this hole. The well bore was drilled with oil-based mud from kick-off to TD. Five m of Draupne Formation was penetrated at 1686 m. The Sognefjord Formation reservoir was encountered with gas at 1691 m. As expected no GOC was encountered, but the GOC is assumed to be the same as in well bore 31/2-17 A. One horizontal core (2.8 m) was taken at TD. Only MWD logs were run. No fluid sample was taken.


31/2-17 S and 31/2-17A were permanently abandoned, while well 31/2-17 B was temporary plugged and suspended for later re-entry. The wells were classified as oil and gas appraisals.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed in the well bores.

Well: 31/2-18
Wellbore history
 





General


The purpose of well 31/2-18 was to appraise the structure and oil bearing potential of a fault block in the northern part of the Troll West Gas province (TWGP). The objectives for drilling well 31/2-18 were to evaluate the structure for future development of oil producing wells in the TWGP-North area, and to determine the degree of development required to efficiently develop the oil reservoir in the TWGP-North area. Well 31/2-18A was drilled as a pre-planned sidetrack to Well 31/2-18 in order to evaluate the hydrocarbon potential of the Krossfjord Formation. The primary objective of the sidetrack was to evaluate a seismic anomaly, or "flat spot" which had been identified in the Krossfjord Formation. The location of the anomaly was situated 240 m to the northeast in an up thrown block, adjacent to the original well.


Operations


Appraisal well 31/2-18 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation "Treasure Saga" on 15 September 1992, and drilled to a total depth of 1711 m in the Middle Jurassic Fensfjord Formation. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 940 m and with KCl/Polymer mud from 940 m to TD.


Palaeocene sand was encountered below base Våle Formation, from 1519.9 m to 1528.8 m. This sand is in direct contact with the underlying Late Jurassic Sognefjord Formation, which was encountered over the interval 1528.8 m - 1642.7 m. Gas was proven all through these sands from top of the Palaeocene sand down to 1571.2 m in the Sognefjord Formation. A thin oil leg was identified, with an oil-water contact at 1582.0 m. Sixteen good RFT pressure measurements, including segregated samples at 1575 m and 1582 m, were taken in one run over the interval 1522 m & 1689.5 m. The interval from 1498 m to 1678.5 m (Lower Rogaland Group including the Palaeocene sand, Sognefjord Formation, and Heather Formation) was cored in twelve cores with 86 100 % recovery.
                


After running wire line logs, well 31/2-18 A was sidetracked with "Treasure Saga" from the original well on 7 October 1992. The sidetrack was initiated at 1470 m, just below the 9-5/8" casing shoe, and reached a total depth of 2005 m in the Krossfjord Formation. The sidetrack was drilled with KCl/Polymer mud.
                


Equivalent to the primary well bore the Våle Formation occurred from 1497 m to 1520 m, on top of a 9.6 m thick Paleocene sand. This sand was found gas bearing and in communication with the underlying Sognefjord Formation. The Sognefjord Formation was encountered between 1529.6 m and 1654.5 m and proved to be gas bearing down to 1572.9 m MD (1570.8 m TVD RKB). A thin oil zone was identified between 1572.9 m and 1584.5 m, (1570.8 - 1581.9 m TVD RKB). The Krossfjord Formation was encountered at 1915.5 m, and was found to be oil bearing from 1915.5 m to 1925.1 m, (1828.5 - 1835.0 m TVD RKB). Two segregated samples at 1919.3 m and 1584 m and a total of 20 pressure measurements and were taken in two RFT runs. No conventional cores were cut in the sidetrack.
                


After running wire line logs, the well was plugged back, without testing, to the 9-5/8" casing shoe on 13 October 1992. Wellbore 31/2-18 was subsequently permanently plugged and abandoned as an oil and gas appraisal well on 17 October 1992.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 31/2-20 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/2-20 S was drilled from the Troll B platform as a joint Pl054 and Pl191 activity. The objective was to investigate the Hydrocarbon-potential in the "P/Q"-prospect shortly west of the Troll West oil province. The main objective was the middle Jurassic Brent Group. A structural closure in the Late Jurassic Fensfjord formation was a secondary target.


Operations and results


Exploration well 31/2-20 S was kicked off on 27 November 2002 from the 13 3/8" casing at 2447/1468 m MD/TVD RKB in production well 31/2-E-3H/AY1H/AY2H/AY3H on the Troll B platform. It was drilled to TD at 3400/1928 m MD/TVD RKB in the Brent group without significant problems. It was drilled as an 8 1/2 " hole from kick-off to TD using a KCl/polymer mud. The main results were:


The P/Q prospect was found to be dry. No hydrocarbon shows were observed in the Brent Group


The Sognefjord Formation sandstones were encountered with oil and gas according to prognosis (GOC and OWC were met at 2695 m/1545.5 m MD/TVD MSL and 2759.2 m/1572 m MD/TVD MSL respectively). No other contacts were observed.


Top Brent was penetrated 39 m deeper than expected ? basically due to higher than expected Jurassic interval velocities. A hydrocarbon fluid-inclusion study performed concludes: No fluorescent hydrocarbon fluid inclusions are observed, either in cemented fractures or in quartz overgrowth, which confirm low probability of any petroleum charging during geologic time.


The well was drilled with return to seabed from seafloor 355m to setting depth of 15 5/8" casing at 1146m. MWD was run through the whole well. In the interval 2457-3400m MD RKB an LWD-suite comprising GR, resistivity, density, neutron, and sonic logs was run. No wire line survey was run. No cores were taken. No biostratigraphic evaluation has been performed. No fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 8 December. Oil and gas was encountered in the Sognefjord Formation as expected, but the exploration targets were dry.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 31/2-21 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/2-21 S was drilled to test the Gotama prospect between the Troll and the Fram Fields in the northern North Sea. The primary exploration target was to prove petroleum in Late Jurassic reservoir rocks (Intra Draupne Formation Sandstone). The secondary exploration target was proving petroleum in Late and Middle Jurassic reservoir rocks (Sognefjord, Fensfjord, Krossfjord formations and the Brent Group).


Operations and results


Wildcat well 31/2-21 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Borgland Dolphin on 28 April 2014 and drilled to TD at 3217 m (3009 m TVD) in the Early Jurassic Cook Formation. No significant problem was encountered in the operations. The well was drilled with seawater and sweeps down to 921 m and with Performadril mud with 4-5% glycol from 921 m to TD.
                


The Intra Draupne Formation reservoir was not present in the well. Reservoirs with medium to good quality were found in Sognefjord Formation, Krossfjord/Fensfjord Formation, Brent Group and Cook Formation. All reservoir sections proved to be water wet on the MWD/LWD logs. At 2300m, a dark yellow direct fluorescence (mineral fluorescence?) with no cut fluorescence and no residual ring was described. Except for this there were not described any shows in the well.


No cores were cut A dry hole wire line program was run. No fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 4 June 2014 as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 31/3-1
Wellbore history
 





General


The wildcat 31/3-1 was drilled ca 17 km NNE of well 13/6-1 in the Troll East area. The two wells were drilled at the same time and together they established the existence of a Troll East gas field. The objective of 31/3-1 was to test possible gas and oil accumulations in sandstones of Late to Middle Jurassic age. Secondary objective was to test possible hydrocarbon accumulations in Middle to Early Jurassic and Late Triassic.
                


Operations and results


Wildcat well 31/3-1 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Bergen on 17 July 1983 and drilled to TD at 2374 m in the Triassic Hegre Group. No significant problems occurred during drilling except some technical problems when running the BOP for the 26" section. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 865 m, with KCl/polymer from 865 m to 1300 m, with gel/lignosulphonate from 1300 m to 1833 m, and with lignite/lignosulphonate from 1833 m to TD.
                


Top reservoir (Sognefjord Formation) was encountered at 1351.5 m. The Sognefjord, Heather, and Fensfjord Formations were found to hold a gas column of ca 220 m gas down to an approximate 4 m oil column. The OWC was at ca 1576m.Geochemical analyses of the reservoir gas show clear signs of biodegradation. Neither the Early Jurassic nor the Late Triassic contained hydrocarbons.
                


Twelve cores were cut continuously from 1351 m to 1610 m in the Late and Middle Jurassic reservoir sequences. FMT fluid samples were taken at 1374.2 m, 1570 m, 1574.2 m, and 1579.2 m.


The well was permanently abandoned on 13 October 1983 as a gas appraisal well.


Testing


Two DST's were performed, and gas was produced from both. DST 1 was performed from the interval 1519 m to 1529 m and produced 842400 Sm3 gas /day on a 22 mm choke. The gas had a gravity of 0.635 (air = 1). DST2 was performed from the interval 1373 m to 1383 m and produced 733500 Sm3 gas /day on a 19 mm choke. The gas had a gravity of 0.635 (air = 1). Turbulence was a problem during the tests. Although stable static bottom hole temperatures were not obtained the data indicated a reservoir temperature of 54.8 deg C at 1353 m. With a seafloor temperature of 4 deg C this correspond to a linear temperature gradient of 51 deg C/km from top reservoir to the sea floor.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 31/3-2
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/3-2 was drilled immediately to the southeast of a fault that was interpreted as a boundary fault between Troll West and Troll East. The main objectives of the appraisal well 31/3-2 were to determine if hydrocarbons were present on the downthrown south side of the fault, to determine the contacts, and to determine the degree of communication across the fault plane. A test would be performed in the case of moveable hydrocarbons, in order to observe boundary effects where the pay zone is narrow and thin. The well was planned to reach total depth in the Early Jurassic Drake Formation at 2050 m if drilling through the "boundary fault". In the case of drilling entirely within the hanging-wall block the total depth was estimated to 2130 m.


Operations and results


Well 31/3-2 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Treasure Seeker on 5 March 1984 and drilled to TD at 2090 m in claystones of the Early Jurassic Drake Formation. No significant technical problems occurred during drilling and testing. The well was drilled with pre-hydrated gel/seawater with sweeps of high viscous mud down to 629 m and with KCl/polymer mud from 629 m to TD.


The Sognefjord Formation (1567 - 1706 m) was found oil bearing down to 1578.5 m where the oil/water contact was established. The oil-bearing reservoir consisted of very fine to very coarse-grained sandstones. They are friable to loose with only traces of siliceous or calcareous cement. The total net sand in the Sognefjord Formation was calculated to 132 m out of 139 m gross thickness, giving a net/gross ratio of 0.95 and an average porosity of 26.6%. A thin (0.5 m) gas cap could be present on top of the oil column. This was identified from LDT/CNL logs and was also consistent with the GOR development during the test, but was not confirmed by RFT data. There were no oil shows above the Sognefjord Formation, and no oil shows below1595 m, and the Middle to Early Jurassic sandstones was found water bearing.


Evidence from seismic interpretations, dip meter analysis, and subsequent geometrical considerations indicated that well 31/3-2 penetrated the "boundary fault" at top Brent Group level, between 1940 and 1955 m. In this zone two calcite cemented bands were encountered thought to be associated with the fault plane. The OWC was found to be 3.5 m shallower than in well 31/2-6, but the pressure data from wells in the area did not have sufficient reproducibility and resolution to support different pressure regimes in the different compartments.
                


Five cores were cut between 1565 m and 1640 m from the lower part of the Draupne Formation and into the Sognefjord Formation. RFT pressure recordings and sampling were performed in the reservoir interval and pressure tests were also made in sand intervals in the underlying formations with the deepest point in the Drake Formation (Dunlin Group). Segregated RFT fluid samples were recovered from 1567.6 m (two samplings, one with oil and one with gas and oil), 1576 m (mud filtrate and water), and 1577.8 m (mud filtrate with trace oil and gas),
                


The well was permanently abandoned on 30 April 1984 as a gas and oil appraisal.


Testing


One production test was performed over the interval 1567 - 1577 m in the oil zone at the top of the Sognefjord Formation. The test produced 1271.9 Sm3 /day of 27.5 deg. API oil together with 562588 Sm3/day of gas with gravity 0.620 (air = 1). The choke size was 63.5 mm. The GOR was 442 Sm3/Sm3 and the CO2 content was 1.0%. The pore pressure at the top of the reservoir was measured to be 158.15 bara (2293.8 psi). The temperature measured during the test was 69.5 deg. C.

Well: 31/3-4
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/3-4 was drilled to test the Mantra prospect, ca 2 km northeast of the northern end of the Troll Field in the North Sea. The primary objective was to test Late Jurassic sandstones of the Sognefjord, Fensfjord and Krossfjord formations, secondary to test the Middle Jurassic Brent Group, tertiary to test injectite sands in the Paleocene.
                


Operations and results


Wildcat well 31/3-4 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Transocean Barents on 22 November 2013 and drilled to TD at 2122 m in the Middle Jurassic Etive Formation. The 9 7/8" pilot hole did not encounter any boulders or shallow gas. Due to severe mud losses in Ness Formation coal beds, the well did not fulfil the objective to drill through the complete Brent section, but all target reservoir levels were tested by the well. The well was drilled with seawater and bentonite sweeps down to 747 m, and with Glydril mud from 747 m to TD.
                


Reservoirs with good to excellent quality were found in Paleocene Lista Formation, Sognefjord Formation, Krossfjord Formation, and Fensfjord Formation and in the Brent Group. All target reservoirs were dry. Only very weak shows were described on a junk basket core from undifferentiated intra-Lista Formation sandstone at 1353 m, and on cuttings from the Sognefjord and Fensfjord formations.
                


A junk basket core was recovered from 1353 to 1353.4 m. No fluid sample was taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 5 January 2014 as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 31/5-1
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/5-1 was drilled as an appraisal well at the southern part of the Troll West Field. The purpose of the well was to test the reservoir qualities, the oil/gas columns, and the hydrocarbon/water contact in the area.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 31/5-1 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Treasure Saga on 5 September 1983. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills all through. After drilling to 860 m and setting the 20" casing, the BOP was run on riser. When the BOP was 12 m above the well head the drill pipe elevator broke, and the BOP dropped down and damaged the well head. The BOP and some riser joints were recovered before the rig was towed to Bergen where the BOP was changed.


No cores were cut and no wire line fluid samples were taken.


The well was abandoned on 30 September 1983 as a junk well. After repairs Treasure Saga returned to the location on 5 October 1983 to spud replacement well 31/5-2.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 31/5-2
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/5-2 is a replacement well for well 3/5-1 in the southern part of the Troll West Field. Well 31/5-1 was terminated at 860 m and junked due to an incident where the BOP and riser was lost. Due to this, the rig left the location and went to Bergen for repairs. It returned to the location five days later for drilling 31/5-2. The purpose of the well was to test the reservoir qualities, the oil/gas columns, and the hydrocarbon/water contact in the area.
                


Operations and results


Appraisal well 31/5-2 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Treasure Saga on 5 October 1983 and was drilled to TD at 2500 m in the Late Triassic Hegre Group. A total of 5 days were lost on setting the 18 3/4" x 9 5/8" seal-assembly, otherwise no significant technical problems occurred in the operations. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 860 m and with KCl/polymer mud from 860 m to TD.
                


Well 31/5-2 penetrated top reservoir at 1521 m. The interval 1521 - 1569 m was gas bearing with 30% porosity and 15% water saturation. The interval from 1569 - 1582 m was oil bearing with 27% porosity and 30% water saturations. These intervals were the only hydrocarbon bearing intervals in the well. Between 1569 and 1582 m there were good shows in the cores. They showed brown oil stain, golden-yellow fluorescence and instant cloudy, milky, white cut. There was strong hydrocarbon odour.


A total of six cores were taken in the interval 1505.0 -1599.9 m, covering the basal 16 m of the Draupne Formation and the upper 78 m of the Sognefjord Formation. The core recovery was 81%. FMT segregated fluid samples were taken at 1563 m (gas), 1575 m (oil at 135 bar), and 1581 (oil at 90 bar).


After surveying, logging and sidewall coring, the well was plugged back to 1902 m and suspended on 11 November 1984. The well was to be re-entered at a later stage for testing.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 31/5-3
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/5-3 was drilled in the southern part of the Troll West Field. The main objectives were to appraise and test the reservoir qualities and the lithology of the Late Jurassic Sognefjord Formation.
                


Operations and results


Well 31/5-3 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Treasure Saga on 10 April 1984 and drilled to TD at 2250 m in the Late Jurassic Drake Formation. At 1426 m circulation was lost, and 450 bbls mud was lost to formation before the well was stabilized. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 950 m, with KCl/polymer mud from 950 m to 1497 m, and with a Pro-wate/NaCl-brine/pro-salt mud from 1497 m to TD.


The well proved the existence of a stratigraphy ranging from Lower Jurassic to Quarternary. The Tertiary and Quaternary sections were mainly composed of claystones, with a minor sand developed in Pleistocene at the base of the Nordland Group. The Jurassic was composed of sandstone and siltstones in the Viking and Brent Groups, and mainly claystone with an interbedded sandstone layer in the Dunlin Group. One major unconformity was found between Early Portlandian and Maastrichtian. Four other unconformities were also observed in the well, from Aalenian to Bathonian, from Early Kimmeridgian to Early Portlandian, from Late Oligocene to Pliocene, and one intra-Oligocene.


The Sognefjord Formation was hydrocarbon bearing with a 39.5 m hydrocarbon column, of which 17.5 m was gas and 22 m was oil. Top reservoir was found at 1555 m, the GOC was at 1572.5 m, and the OWC at 1594.5 m. Oil shows persisted further down, but decreased from 1595 m and disappeared below 1622 m. No other interval in the well was hydrocarbon bearing.


Three cores were cut from 1550 m to 1622.5 m in the Late Jurassic Sognefjord Formation. FMT gas samples were taken at 1557 m and 1567. Three more FMT fluid samples were taken in the oil zone at 1577 m, 1591 m, and at 1592 m.


The well was permanently abandoned on 9 June 1984 as a gas and oil appraisal well.


Testing


Two drill stem tests were performed in the Sognefjord Formation. Both the intervals were gravel packed. DST # 1 from 1606 - 1610 m produced formation water. DST # 2 from 1582.3 - 1586.3 m produced 1100 Sm3/day of oil with a constant GOR of approximately 55Sm3/Sm3. Gas coning occurred as the rate was increased to 1550 m /day. The GOR stabilized at its original value as the rate was reduced to 1050 Sm3 /day

Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/5-4 A was drilled as a horizontal side track to well 31/5-4 S in the Troll West oil and gas province. The well objective was test production from the 13 m oil layer in the Sognefjord Formation. The test production should evaluate the oil production potential from the Troll West Gas Province, obtain dynamic data from a potential development type well, and obtain static reservoir and geological data to provide proper understanding of well behaviour.
                


Operations and results


Well bore 31/5-4 A was kicked off from 31/5-4 S at 1569 m on 10 October 1990, using the semi-submersible installation Transocean 8. Due to difficulties in building sufficient angle, the well was plugged back and technically sidetracked from 1604 m. The 9 5/8" casing was set horizontally at 1803 m, and the well drilled horizontally for another 800 m to TD at 2603 m in the Late Jurassic Sognefjord Formation. The well was drilled with Carbotec oil based mud from kick-off to TD. The horizontal section was drilled in the oil bearing part, approximately 1 meter above the oil-water contact.  No cores were cut and no fluid samples taken. The well was completed with a prepacked screen in the horizontal section. A clean-up test and a production logging test was conducted with the Transocean 8 before the well was suspended on 13 Dcember 1990 and connected to the vessel Petrojarl I for a long-term production test. Well 31/5-4 A is classified as an oil and gas appraisal well.


Testing


The well was tested from the horizontal interval in the Sognefjord Formation beyond the 9 5/8" casing shoe , i.e. 1801-2603 m RKB / 1578.5 m TVD RKB +/- 0.3 m. The measured test data from the end of the second and final production logging period, with the production logging tool (PLT) at 1825 m / 1578.5 m TVD RKB, were reported as follows: Oil rate = 217 Sm3/day, gas rate = 11869 Sm3/day, water rate = 318 Sm3/day, GOR = 55 Sm3/Sm3, CO2 content = 1%, oil density = 0.893 g/cm3, relative gas density = 0.64 (air = 1), flowing bottom hole pressure (FBHP) = 158.85 bar, and flowing bottom hole temperature (FBHT) = 69.5 deg. C.

Well: 31/5-5
Wellbore history
 





General


The well was drilled as part of the appraisal programme initiated for the southern part of the Troll West Gas province (TWGP-S). The objectives of the well were to provide geological, geophysical and petrophysical data for evaluation of the potential for a group of oil producers in TWGP-S; and to provide data on the Fensfjord and Krossfjord Formations to improve aquifer modelling. The well was further planned for later re-entry, either for sidetracking and completion as a horizontal producer, or for vertical recompletion for Sognefjord Formation reservoir monitoring.


Operations and results


Well 31/5-5 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation West Delta on 30 December 1992 and drilled to a total depth at 1930 m in the Middle Jurassic Krossfjord Formation. The well was drilled with spud mud to 940 m and with KCl/brine from 940 m to TD.


The Sognefjord Formation was encountered from 1572 m to 1725 m, and was hydrocarbon bearing. Strong oil shows were recorded from 1573 m to1587.5 m, weaker oil shows were recorded below this depth down to 1650 m. The gas-oil contact was identified at 1573.5, and the oil-water contact was identified at 1585.5 m. From FMT pressure tests a gas gradient of 0.152 g/cc, an oil gradient of 0.825 g/cc, and a water gradient of 1.02 g/cc was defined. Twelve conventional cores were cut. The first ten were from 1555 m in the top of the Sognefjord Formation to1726 m, one meter into the Fensfjord Formation. Cores 11 and 12 were cut from 1835 m in the Fensfjord Formation to 1888 m in the Krossfjord Formation. FMT fluid samples were taken at 1583 m (two samples, both contained oil and gas), 1576.5 m (oil and gas), and at 1571 m (gas).
                


The well was temporarily plugged at 1450 m and 450 m using two 9 5/8" Baker type N1 bridge plugs and suspended as an oil and gas appraisal well on 11 February 1993.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed

Well: 31/5-6
Wellbore history
 





General


The objective for well 31/5-6 was to test the hydrocarbon potential of the Jurassic U-structure in PL 191 west of the Troll Field. The primary targets were to test the hydrocarbon potential of the Sognefjord and Fensfjord Formations of the Viking Group. Secondary targets were to test the hydrocarbon potential of the Brent Group and to test the possibility of hydrocarbons being present in the Våle Formation of the Rogaland Group.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 31/5-6 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation "Scarabeo 6" on 5 July 2000 and drilled to TD at 2370 m in the Early Jurassic Drake Formation. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 1201 m and with water based "Glydril" mud from 1201 m to TD. More than 400 m of upper Jurassic Viking Group sediments were penetrated in well 31/5-6 U-structure. About half of the Viking Group is composed of the sand-rich, shallow marine Sognefjord, Fensfjord and Krossfjord Formations; the remaining is assigned the Heather Formation and a very thin Draupne Formation. The potential Sognefjord and Fensfjord reservoirs were found water bearing, although weak shows were reported in the uppermost part of the Sognefjord Formation. The Brent Group was 126 m thick and consisted of the Tarbert, Ness, Etive, Rannoch and Oseberg formation equivalents. Also the Brent Group was found water bearing although weak shows were reported in the uppermost part of the Tarbert formation equivalent. No conventional cores were cut and no fluid samples were taken. The well was permanently abandoned as a dry well with shows on 25 July 2000.

Well: 31/6-1
Wellbore history
 





General


The primary objectives of the wildcat 31/6-1 was to test Late and Middle Jurassic sandstones on the main culmination of the Troll east structure in the western part of block 31/6. Secondary objectives were Middle to Early Jurassic and Triassic sandstones and a possible sandstone reservoir of pre-Triassic age within a set of tilted fault blocks buried by Triassic strata. The Troll east structure is a large tilted fault block containing Jurassic and older strata. The closure


at Sognefjord Formation level is delineated by a flatspot covering most of the 31/6 block. The flatspot was expected to be a gas/fluid contact evident on the seismic and penetrated by nine wells in the Troll West area to the NNW in block 31/2. Planned TD of the well was 3800 m into rocks of pre-Triassic (? Devonian age).


Operations and results


Wildcat well 31/6-1 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Nortrym on 15 July 1983 and drilled to TD at 4070 m in pre-Devonian basement rock. Problems with getting logging tools past the 30" casing shoe occurred due to gumbo problems. Further drilling went forth without major problems. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 425 m, with seawater / prehydrated gel and hi-vis pills from 425 m to 749 m, and with KCl/polymer/PHPA mud from 749 m to TD
                


The total net sand in the Viking Group (1352-1805 m) found to be 424.25 m giving a net/gross ratio of 0.94 m with an average porosity of 27.5%. The Sognefjord Formation (1352-1488 m), the Heather Formation Unit B, (1488-1517.5 m) and the upper part of the Fensfjord Formation were found gas bearing from 1352 to 1571 m where the gas/oil contact was found. Below this a thin (3 m) oil zone was present with an oil/water contact at approximately 1574 m. The hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir consisted of very fine to fine grained sandstones, occasionally medium to coarse. They were generally friable to loose with a few tight calcite cemented stringers. The gross hydrocarbon column is 222 m and the net pay was calculated to be 198 m with an average porosity of 28.7% and an average water saturation of 19.1%.
                


Triassic rocks (Hegre Group) were encountered at 2155.5 m. The basal part of the Triassic was characterized by homogenous shales, which were easily distinguished on wire line logs by their high gamma ray (100 - 120 API units). The shales are moderate brown to red brown, micromicaceous, silty and predominantly much more calcareous than the overlying interval. This interval has been dated as Scythian to Anisian down to 3925 m, (?) Scythian to 3978 m and indeterminate down to crystalline basement rocks of indeterminate age at 4013 m. The middle to lower Jurassic and Triassic sandstones were found water bearing.
                


FMT pressure recordings and sampling were performed over the reservoir interval. A few pressure readings were also taken in the Cook Formation (Dunlin Group), but these were invalid and were not used for pressure gradient evaluations. The valid data gave a gas gradient of 0.012 bar/m (0.053 psi/ft) with an underlying water gradient of 0.099 bar/m (0.437 psi/ft). The interposed oil gradient is estimated to be 0.086 bar/m (0.38 psi/ft). FMT fluid samples were taken at 1371 m, (gas) 1444.6 m (gas), 1564.0 m (gas), 1564.6 m (gas), 1570.2 m (gas and water/mud filtrate), 1573.6 m (gas, 0.75 l oil, and water/mud filtrate), and 1576.5 m (no gas, 8.9 l water/mud filtrate). A total of 20 cores were cut continuously from the Heather Formation siltstone interval below the Draupne Formation down into the Fensfjord Formation sandstones, across the OWC in core no 17. A total of 235.4 m core was recovered. One 0.3 m core (core no 20) was cut in gneiss at TD. In addition to this, 225 sidewall cores were successfully recovered.


The well was permanently abandoned on as a gas and oil discovery


Testing


Two production tests were successfully performed over two intervals in the gas zone. Both tests were gravel pack completions. DST No 1 (1562.5 - 1567.5 m) in the Fensfjord Formation in the lower part of the gas zone, produced 842000 Sm3/day) of 0.635 gravity gas (air =1) through a 22.2 mm choke (56/64"). DST No 2 (1435 - 1441 m) was performed in the lower part of the Sognefjord Formation and flowed 733000 Sm3 /day of gas through a 19 mm (48/64") choke. Gas gravity was 0.650. The pore pressure at the top of the reservoir was measured to be 156.06 bar (2263.5 psi). Maximum temperature recorded during DST1 was 69.4 deg C. Maximum temperature recorded during DST 2 was 64.4 deg C. This correspond to a ca 54 deg C/km linear gradient from the sea floor (assumed at 4 deg C) to top reservoir. This is a very high gradient compared to wells outside of the Troll field.

Well: 31/6-2
Wellbore history
 





General


Appraisal well 31/6-2 was drilled on a location on the south-east periphery on the Troll East gas province. The main objective was to test the gas and oil accumulations in sandstones of Late to Middle Jurassic age. The planned TD was about 200 m into rocks of Triassic age to an estimated total depth of 2400 m RKB.


The well is Reference well for the Hardråde Formation and for the undifferentiated Shetland Group in the Troll area.


Operations and results


Well 31/6-2 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Bergen on 18 October 1983 and drilled to TD at 2020 m in the Early Jurassic Drake Formation. Because of problems with a leak in 20" casing and lost circulation problems in a major fault, both 13 3/8" and 9 5/8" casing had to be set high. The well was drilled with sea water and hi-vis pills down to 412 m, with AQUAGEL/seawater spud mud from 412 m to 801 m, with KCl polymer mud from 801 m to TD. At 984 m Lost Circulation Material -pills were added to cure lost circulation problems.


No reservoir sections were developed above the Jurassic. The well encountered 113 m of Draupne shale with top at 1322 m, overlying a 25 m thick Heather Formation sequence. The Sognefjord Formation sandstone reservoir was encountered at 1460 m with a gas column of approximately 110 m. No oil leg could be detected from electric logs or FMT's. Oil shows were recorded on sidewall core sandstone in the interval from 1831 m to 1988 m in the Middle to Early Jurassic. Nine cores were cut from 1435 m to 1619 m in the Heather and Sognefjord Formations. FMT sampling in the Sognefjord Formation recovered small amounts of gas from 1475 m and 1572 m. A sample from 1577 m gave mud filtrate.


The well was suspended on 11 December 1983 as a gas appraisal.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 31/6-3
Wellbore history
 





General


The primary objective of the wildcat 31/6-3 was to assess possible hydrocarbon accumulations in the sands and sandstones of the Late Jurassic Sognefjord Formation. The target was prospect C, a structural trap in the southeastern corner of block 31/6 extending into the adjacent blocks 31/9, 32/4 and 32/7. The well was located on the apex of prospect C. The secondary objective of the well was to obtain Sedimentological data for the Sognefjord Formation sandstones in the well location. The well was planned to reach total depth at ca 2200 m, approximately 100 m into the Triassic.


Operations and results


The well was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Nortrym on 1 November 1983. Repositioning of the rig had to be done due to anchoring problems. At 1950 m the drill string was hung off. Problems when attempting to retrieve the drill string resulted in pulling of BOP. When running in hole after 7 days, 10 m of fill was found. No other major problems occurred during drilling and the well reached planned TD at 2250 m in the Triassic Hegre Group. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 618 m and with KCl/Polymer mud from 618 m to TD.


The well encountered water-bearing sandstones in the Late/Middle Jurassic Sognefjord Formation as well as in the lower lying sandstones. No oil shows were noted on cores, sidewall cores or cuttings in any section of the well. Gas readings were low or nil throughout except for a 2.6% methane reading in a shallow sand unit at 414 m. The Sognefjord Formation sandstones (1511-1647 m) are very fine to fine, occasionally medium grained, micaceous, occasionally carbonaceous and slightly argillaceous. In places the sandstones grade into siltstones. They are well to moderately sorted and have fair visible porosity. The underlying Sognefjord, Fensfjord, and Krossfjord Formations (1647-1931.5m) are dominated by fine to medium, locally very fine or coarse grained sandstones which are often calcite cemented and have a fair visible porosity. Occasional interbeds of siltstone are also present together with some stringers of limestone, in the upper part yellow brown and very hard, becoming light grey and softer further down. The log evaluation gave a net sand thickness of 382,75 m out of a gross thickness of 420,5 m for the interval (1511 m to 1931.5 m) with an average porosity of 21.0% and an average water saturation of 96.1% (cut-off values used in the calculations were: 0<0,12, VSH>0,40). Eighteen FMT pressure test were performed over the interval 1513,5 m to 2146 m. From the pressure tests a water gradient of 0.1012 bar/m (1.033 g/cc) was calculated. A total of twelve cores were cut in the well. The cores recovered most of the Heather and Sognefjord Formations, and 25 m from the upper part of Fensfjord Formatio. No fluid samples were taken in the well.
                


The well was permanently abandoned as a dry well on 26 December 1983.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed

Well: 31/6-4
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/6-4 was drilled in the southern part of the Troll East gas province. The main purpose was to appraise and test possible oil and gas accumulations in sandstones of Late to Middle Jurassic age.
                


Operations and results


Appraisal well 31/6-4 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Bergen on 5 March 1984 and drilled to TD at 820 m in Eocene sediments. After setting of the 30" casing a 12 1/4" pilot hole was drilled. When opening the pilot hole to 26" hole, the hole holed kicked off from the pilot hole and deviated to 12.75 deg. at 662 m. Because of the deviation it was decided to junk the well. The well was drilled with spud mud.


No cores were cut and no fluid samples taken.


The well was junked and abandoned on 16 March as a dry well.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 31/6-5
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/6-5 was drilled in the southern part of the Troll East gas province, 30 m from well 31/6-4, which was junked for technical reasons. The main purpose was to appraise and test possible oil and gas accumulations in sandstones of Late to Middle Jurassic age, and to give further information about lateral facies changes within the reservoir sandstones.
                


Operations and results


Appraisal well 31/6-5 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Bergen on 5 March 1984 and drilled to TD at 2082 m in the Early Jurassic Drake Formation. In the 26" hole lost circulation occurred at 653 m, two cement plugs were set. Several wiper trips were taken due to tight hole. After setting of the 20" casing, the BOP had to be repaired due to leaking during pressure testing. A drilling break occurred at 1476 m in the 12 1/4" hole. The well was drilled with the spud mud from the previous hole (31/6-4) treated with CMC-EHV down to 389 m, with seawater/gel mud from 389 m to 663 m, with KCl/polymer mud from 663 m to 1720 m, and with seawater/gel/CMC mud from 1720 m to TD.


Sandstone of Late to Middle Jurassic age (Sognefjord Formation) was encountered at 1518 m with a 52 m gas column and a 4 m oil column. The gas/oil contact was at 1570 m and the oil/water contact at 1574 m. Oil shows were recorded on sidewall cores on top Fensfjord Formation sandstone from 1722 m to 1726 m and on a sandstone SWC from 2010 m in the Ness Formation. Ten cores were cut from 1470 m to 1721 m in the Late to Middle Jurassic sequence (Heather Formation to Fensfjord Formation). One FMT fluid sample was taken in the oil zone 1571.5 m. Geochemical analyses showed the oil to be biodegraded.


The well was permanently abandoned on 16 March 1984 as a gas and oil appraisal.


Testing


The Sognefjord Formation was tested through gravel pack from the interval 1558 m to 1568 m. The first test gave a non-representative flow due to obstructions in the hole. The second test, termed Test 1A, was ok and produced gas at a maximum rate of 1266000 Sm3/day on a 1.5" choke. Geochemical analyses showed the gas to be 92.4% methane and biodegraded.

Well: 31/6-6
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 31/6-6 was drilled in the Troll East gas province. It was designed to test possible gas accumulations in the Late to Middle Jurassic sandstones and to test the quality of a reservoir siltstone in the Heather Formation.


Operations and results


Well 31/6-6 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Bergen on 22 May 1984 and drilled to TD 2293 m in the Late Triassic Hegre Group. No significant problem was encountered in the operations. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 716 m, with KCl/polymer mud from 716 m to 1771.5 m, and with pre-hydrated bentonite/CMC mud from 1771.5 m to TD.
                


The well encountered gas from top Heather reservoir at 1516 m to a GWC at 1568.5 m, 7.5 m into the Sognefjord Formation. No oil shows were reported from the well. Nine conventional cores were cut in the interval 1525 m to 1771.5 m in the Middle to Late Jurassic. FMT samples were taken at 1571.8 m and 1576.5 m in the Sognefjord Formation. Both contained formation water and mud filtrate.


The well was completed on 29 July 1984 as a gas appraisal.


Testing


Two drill stem tests were performed in the well. DST 1A tested 1562 m to 1567.5 m in the Sognefjord Formation sandstone. It produced maximum 779 x 10 Sm3 gas /day on a 64/64" choke. DST 2 from 1523 m to 1536 m in the Heather Formation siltstone showed a very low production rate, 10.7 x 10 Sm3/day. The reservoir temperature was 62.5 deg. C in DST 1A and 58 deg. C in DST 2.

Well: 31/6-7
Wellbore history
 





General


Appraisal well 31/6-7 was drilled in the south-west corner of the Troll East gas province. The main objectives of the well was to determine the lateral extent of the reservoir, to determine the fluid contacts in the Sognefjord Formation and to obtain the best possible seismic correlation within the reservoir from well 31/6-1. If hydrocarbons were encountered the well would be tested to obtain a number of reservoir engineering parameters: permeabilities and skin, fluid samples, pressure/temperature drops in tubing at various flow rates, reservoir inflow at high flow rates, and behaviour of gravel pack at high rates.


Operations and results


Well 31/6-7 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Treasure Seeker on 1 April 1985 and drilled to TD at 698 m in Oligocene sediments. After drilling the 26" hole to 694 m, and setting the 20" casing it was discovered that the angle of the 18 3/8" wellhead was 2.5 degrees and it was decided to junk the well. The well was permanently plugged and abandoned on 13 April 1985, and the rig was moved 50 m due north to spud replacement well 31/6-8.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed

Well: 31/6-8
Wellbore history
 





General


Appraisal well 31/6-8 was drilled in the south-west corner of the Troll East gas province, 50 m due north of well 31/6-7, which was junked and abandoned for technical reasons. The main objectives were to determine the lateral extent of the reservoir, to determine the fluid contacts in the Sognefjord Formation, and to obtain the best possible seismic correlation within the reservoir from well 31/6-1. In addition, an elaborate testing program was planned to obtain a number of reservoir engineering parameters.


Operations and results


Well 31/6-8 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Treasure Seeker on 14 April 1985 and drilled to TD at Drilling the well proceeded without significant problems. The interval down to setting depth for 20" casing was not logged, as this interval was considered covered by logs from well 31/6-7. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 700 m, with KCl Polymer mud from 700 m to 1465 m, and with "drill in fluid" (NaCl, polymers, and CaCO3) from 1465 m to TD. An 8 m3 Imcospot/Pipelax pill was spotted at 2054 m to free the pipe, which was stuck.
                


The Sognefjord Formation (1507-1661 m) was found gas bearing from 1507 m to 1573.5 m and oil bearing from 1573.5 to 1578.5 m where the oil/water contact was found. The oil zone was determined from petrophysical evaluation, core plug saturations and segregated sample recoveries. The hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir consisted of predominantly very fine to fine grained sandstones with some interbedded siltstones. The gross hydrocarbon column was 71.5 m and the net pay calculated to 67 m with an average porosity of 33% and average water saturation of 16.2 %. No hydrocarbon indications were recorded above 1507 m or below 1579 m.


Twelve cores were cut in the Late to Middle Jurassic Sognefjord and Heather Formations from 1489 m to 1700 m (148 m total recovery). FMT segregated samples were taken at 1573.2 m (0.7 Sm3 gas, 0.5 l water/filtrate, and 6 l oil in 2.75 gallon chamber) and at 1578.8 m (0.1 Sm3 gas, 0.5 l oil, and 9.8 l water/filtrate in 2.75 gallon chamber).


The well was temporarily suspended 25 may 1985, and subsequently re-entered for testing 20 July 1985.

General
                


Wildcat well 32/4-1 was the first well drilled in Production Licence 205. It is located on the Horda Platform in the Northern North Sea about five kilometers east of the East Troll Gas Field. The primary objective of the well was to prove commercial reserves within the Upper Jurassic Sognefjord Formation sand reservoirs. The Alpha prospect was believed to be filled with oil spilled from the Troll Field. Secondary objectives were present in potential stacked Upper, Middle and Lower Jurassic sand reservoirs, in Triassic, and in possible Paleozoic sand reservoirs.
                


Operations and results
                


Well 32/4-1 was spudded 21 October 1996, using the semi-submersible drilling rig "Transocean 8". The first attempt to drill the well failed after experiencing problems when running the 13 3/8" casing. The casing unscrewed and parted at 619 m. The hole was filled with cement and abandoned. The rig was moved about 50 m to the north and the well was respudded. The well was drilled without major drilling problems, except for some difficulties with getting the 9 5/8" casing hanger through the BOP stack and mud losses when drilling through the Viking Group. The well was drilled into Basement rocks at a total depth of 3186 m. The well was drilled with spud mud to 720 m and water based KCl/Drispac with glycol from 720 m to TD.
                  
The Upper Jurassic reservoir interval was encountered 6 m shallower than prognosed and contained 65.5 m of water-wet Sognefjord sandstones. In addition, water wet sandstones of the secondary targets were present as the Fensfjord, Krossfjord, Cook, Statfjord and Lunde Formations.
                  
Four cores were cut in the Upper Jurassic. The two first were cut in the Heather Formation silt- and sandstones, while core 3 and 4 were cut in sandstones of the Sognefjord Formation (1220-1235.5 m, 1232.5-1237.5 m, 1237.5-1256 m and 1257-1275 m, respectively). A FMT water sample was collected from 1359 m.
                  
The well was permanently plugged and abandoned as a dry well.

Well: 33/2-2 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/2-2 S, was an exploration well drilled to test the Morkel prospect on the eastern down faulted terrace of the Makrell Horst. The well is located 1.7 km northeast of the closest neighbouring well, 33/5-1 (1979), which was drilled on the crest of the horst.
                
The primary exploration target for the well was to prove petroleum in Late and Middle Jurassic reservoir rocks (Intra-Draupne Formation sandstone and the Brent group). The secondary exploration target was to prove hydrocarbons in Early Jurassic (the Statfjord Group) and Late Triassic reservoir rocks (the Lunde Formation).




Operations and results


Wildcat well 33/2-2 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Bredford Dolphin on 2 March 2015 and drilled to TD at 3530 m in the Triassic Teist Formation. No significant problem was encountered in the operations. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 435 m, with Aqua-Drill mud from 435 m to 1754 m, with Carbo-Sea oil based mud from 1754 m to 2793 m, and with Aqua-Drill mud from 2793 m to TD.
                


The Early Cretaceous Mime Formation rest unconformably on the Triassic in the well. The Jurassic, including the primary exploration target was not encountered. In the secondary exploration target, the well encountered oil in the Lunde Formation from 2945 m to 3113 m, of which 12 m sandstone of poor reservoir quality. An ODT at 3112 m (3105 m TVD) is supported by the data, but it is not possible to establish hydrocarbon contacts confidently. Hydrocarbon shows were observed in greater parts of the well: from 1410 to 1650 m, from 2242 to 2260 m, and more or less the whole well below 2941 m.
                


Four cores were cut in the Triassic section. Core 1 and 2 were cut from 2943 to 2960.4 m. Core 3 was cut from 2988.7 to 2997.2 m, and core 4 from 3049 to 3059 m. Core recovery was from 81 to 98%. MDT fluid samples were taken at 2946.3 m (water), 3005.8 m (oil), 3066.9 m (oil), 3079.4 m (oil). Single stage separation of the samples gave GOR's in the range 193 to 219 Sm3/Sm3 and stock-tank oil density in the range 0.819 to 0.822 g/cm3.


The well was permanently abandoned on 10 June 2015 as an oil discovery.


Testing




One drill stem test was performed from the interval 3007.5 to 3115 m in the Lunde Formation. The test produced approximately 20 Sm3 oil and 4500 Sm3 gas /day through an 18/64" choke. The DST confirms the logging and poro-perm assessment indicating that the reservoir formation is rather tight and has low producability. The DST temperature was 121.5 °C

Well: 33/5-1
Wellbore history
 





General


The objective of the well, located on the Makrell horst on the northern margin of the East Shetland Basin, was to test two possible sandstone reservoirs of Triassic and Permo-Triassic age respectively. The first of these reservoirs was prognosed to be an Early Triassic massive sandstone reservoir. Correlation with the U.K. well 211/13-1 indicated that this sandstone could be divided into two main sequences both with increasing silt and clay content in the lower parts. These sands were thought to be deposited in a braided alluvial system. The second was prognosed to be Permo-Triassic fluvial sandstone similar to the higher reservoir but separated from it by lacustrine or lagoonal shales, marls and limestones. The well was planned to reach total depth below a seismic marker at approximately 3825 m.
                


Well 33/5-1 is reference well for the Triassic Teist and Lomvi Formations.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 33/5-1 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Treasure Seeker on 19 July 1979 and drilled to TD at 3829 m in the Early Triassic Teist Formation, interpreted to be close to the seismic "A" marker. A gas leakage from a shallow gas zone at 480 m to 490 m between the 20" and 30" casing was observed sporadically throughout drilling of the well. The leakage was stopped when the gas zone were squeezed off with cement during abandonment of the well. An 18 1/2" hole was first drilled to 1516 m. When pulling out of the hole the string got stuck at 1226 m and the well was sidetracked from 1019 m to 1071 m. Logs are from the sidetrack. Further drilling went without significant problems. The well was drilled with seawater/bentonite/CMC down to 1540 m. Diesel and lubricants were added to the mud when attempting to free the stuck pipe. A lignosulfonite/lignite mud was used from 1540 m to TD.


A sequence of interbedded limestones of Early Tertiary to Late Cretaceous age (Late/Middle Paleocene-Maastrichtian) revealed fair hydrocarbon shows when penetrated. Wire line log interpretations and RFT runs found, however, these limestones to be poor reservoir rocks and to contain residual hydrocarbons only. The Jurassic was absent in the well. Early Cretaceous sediments (Albian age Rødby Formation) were found resting unconformably on the Triassic Lunde Formation. Well 33/5-1 penetrated a 1137 m thick sequence of Triassic rocks. Good sandstone reservoirs were found, but no significant hydrocarbon shows were encountered. A single conventional core was cut from 3066 m to 3076.4 m in the Lunde Formation. Four RFT runs were made for pressure recordings and evaluation of the Lower Tertiary-Upper Cretaceous limestones and the Triassic sandstones. For the Lower Tertiary-Upper Cretaceous sequence, no reliable data were obtained due to tight formations or tool seal failure. The RFT recordings for the Triassic sandstones gave a pressure gradient of 0.11 bar/m (0.48 psi/ft) indicating water-bearing reservoir. Only mud filtrate was recovered from RFT samples taken at 1675 m and 2747.5 m.
                


The well was permanently abandoned as dry on 18 October 1979.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 33/5-2
Wellbore history
 





General


The prime objective of the well 33/5-2 was to test a Late Jurassic sandstone reservoir.  The Middle Jurassic Brent Group and the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation were considered secondary objectives. The Late Jurassic (Early Kimmeridgian) sandstone was assumed to be a continuation of the same deposits recorded at the Magnus Field and in the wells 211/8-1 and 211/13-3.  These deposits constitute the oil reservoir at the Magnus Field and were also hydrocarbon bearing in 211/13-3. This objective was considered a high-risk prospect since the "Magnus Sandstone Member" had previously not been recorded on this side of the 211/13- 33/5- (Makrell-) horst. The Brent Group was expected to be as in the wells 211/13-2 and -6 where it is oil bearing.  It was thought to be a typical shallow to marginal marine sandstone sequence, deposited during shoreline progradation. The location far down flank from the crest of the closure was considered to make hydrocarbon occurrence in the 33/5-2 Brent Group less likely. This was also the case for the Statfjord Formation.  It was expected to consist of fine to coarse, occasionally pebbly sandstones with some shale interbeds of fluvial to marginal marine origin. The well was planned to drill approximately 50 m into the Statfjord Formation with an expected total depth at 4525 m.


Operations and results


A number of "pockmarks" typically 40 m across and 2 m deep were seen in the northern and eastern part of the area of the well location. To get some more information about the uppermost meters of soil, seafloor sampling and analysis were conducted by IKU.  The seabed was found to consist of a fine sand, normally firm with shell fragments, plastic, silty clay and below greyish green sand.
                


Wildcat well 33/5-2 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Nortrym on 31 July 1981 and drilled to a total depth of 4520 m in the Triassic Lunde Formation. The well was drilled with seawater and h-vis pills down to 960 m, with KCl/polymer mud from 960 m to 2714 m, and with KCl/Lignite/lignosulfonite/polymer mud from 2714 m to TD.


When attainting to run the 13 3/8" casing in the hole, the casing got stuck at 1653 m. After displacing Diesel/Milfree around the string, the casing came free and could be landed at 1974.5 m and cemented 100 m back into the 20" casing.
                


The only show recorded above Jurassic was an oil show on a sidewall core from 2525 m in the Late Cretaceous Kyrre Formation. No reservoir sands of Late Jurassic age were encountered in the well. Poor shows were reported in shales of the Kimmeridge Clay Formation. The Middle to Late Jurassic sequence in this well consists of Heather Formation shales on top of Brent Group sands repeated three times. This unusual event is interpreted as the two upper Brent Group sands are sediment packages that have slumped into the heather mudstones during deposition, the deepest Brent sequence likely represent autochthonous Brent. The Uppermost Brent sequence (4054 m to 4111 m) was cored and consists of Tarbert and Rannoch Formation sandstones. Poor to occasionally good shows were recorded from cuttings and from cores 1 and 2 cut over this interval. The logs showed, however, the sand to be water bearing with a water saturation of 91% and an average porosity of 13%. The next Brent sand interval from 4154 m to 4176 m was water bearing with a net sand of 5 m, a water saturation of 78% and an average porosity of 11%, while the deepest Brent sand interval from 4227 m to 4276 m had a net sand of 9 m, and was interpreted water bearing with a water saturation of 70% and an average porosity of 11%. The interval from 4270 m to 4275 m within the deepest Brent sand from 4227 m to 4276 m gave high mud gas readings (5.62%). Oil shows were not recorded on-rig in either of the two deeper Brent sands, but geochemical analyses detected shows of a "medium gravity crude" in the interval 4200 m to 4270. The Lower Jurassic Statfjord Formation was encountered at 4412 m.  No distinct boundary against the underlying Triassic Hegre Group exists. The sandstone was both silica- and calcite cemented with a very low porosity and without any kind of shows.
                


Three cores were cut in this well, all three in the interval from 4053.5 m to 4100.5 m in the Tarbert and Rannoch Formations of the uppermost Brent slump package. No fluid samples were taken in this well.


The well was permanently abandoned on 18 November 1981 as a dry well with oil shows.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed

Well: 33/6-1
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/6-1 is located in the Marulk Basin northwest of the Snorre Field in the southeastern sector of block 33/6. The location was selected on the crestal area of the most attractive feature in the licence: a fault bounded, tilted block. The closure was considered dependent upon the sealing properties of the NE-SW fault to the south of the prospect. The primary objective of the well was to test the Middle-Early Jurassic Brent-Statfjord reservoirs. Planned TD was in the Late Triassic Hegre Group


Operations and results


Exploration well 33/6-1 was spudded on April 9, 1979 in 306 m water depth, the deepest drilling location to that date. Semi-submersible installation Fernstar was used to drill the well. Due to soft bottom conditions and problems with stabilizing the temporary guide base on the sea floor the well was re-spudded twice, the last and successful attempt on April 15. The well reached TD at 3900 m in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation. The well was drilled with seawater and pre-hydrated bentonite down 434 m, with seawater/HPD polymer/bentonite from 434 m to 695 m, with KCl/Dextrid/seawater from 695 m to 1690 m, and with lignosulphonate/fresh water from 1690 m to TD.


The most significant horizons, the top of the Paleocene Seismic Marker and top Cretaceous, came in 13 meters lower and 37,5 meters higher than expected, respectively. The pre-Cretaceous section deviated significantly from prognosis. This was caused by a very crude depth conversion model due to lack of well control in the area and a much thinner Brent thickness than prognosed. All pre-Cretaceous targets were found however. The Late Kimmerian unconformity was encountered 133.5 m high to prognosis. The Late Jurassic shale was 65.5 m thick, 35 meters thicker than prognosed and consisted of 30 m of Draupne Formation plus 35.5 m of Heather Formation.
                


The primary target Brent Group was penetrated at 3603 m, 97 meters higher than prognosed, and only 44 m thick versus the expected 155 m. The Brent reservoir was water wet. This was evident on the logs and was confirmed by no shows on the cuttings, mud, or on core. The Dunlin Group came in at 3647.5 m, 297 m higher than prognosed, and was 144.5 m thick compared to the expected 265 m


The secondary target Statfjord Formation was encountered at 3792 m, 328 m higher than prognosed and was 70 m thick, 10 meters more than predicted. The Statfjord reservoir was water wet. Again this was evident on the logs and was confirmed by no shows on the cuttings, mud, or on core.á
                


Two cores were cut. The first core was cut from 3607 m to 3616 m in the Brent Group and the second from 3802 m to 3807 m in the Statfjord Formation. No fluid samples were taken in this well.


The well was permanently abandoned on 6 July 1979 as a dry well


Testing


No drill stem test was performed

Well: 33/6-2
Wellbore history
 





General


The 33/6-2 well is located to the north of the Statfjord Nord oil field and to Northwest of Snorre oil field. Agip's 33/6-1 well, which was plugged and abandoned dry, was drilled approximately 4 km to the west.
                


The primary objective of the well was the Upper Jurassic (Volgian) Intra-Draupne "Munin sandstone unit" of the Draupne Formation. It was designed to find commercial hydrocarbons in a structural/stratigraphic trap where the Base Munin sub crops the base Cretaceous unconformity. The secondary objective of the well was to test the reserve potential in the Brent Group, intra Dunlin Group and Statfjord Formation sandstones.


Operations and results


Exploration well 33/6-2 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation "Byford Dolphin" on 28 October 1996 and drilled to TD at 3950 m in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 991 m, with KCl/glycol ("ANCO 208") mud from 991 m to 2150 m, and with KCl/polymer/glycol ("ANCO 208") from 2150 m to TD. In the Upper Jurassic two cores were cut in sandstones of the Intra-Draupne sandstone unit. Whilst there were some shows, the sandstones proved to be generally low porosity. In the Early - Middle Jurassic Brent and Dunlin Group sandstones no oil shows were observed and no cores were taken. Weak shows were however observed in shaley/carbonaceous lithologies in this interval, indicating some in-situ generated hydrocarbons. No shows were observed in the Statfjord Formation. RFT fluid samples were retrieved from 3550 m in the Intra-Draupne Sandstone and from 3622 m in the Brent Group. By adding thiocyanate to the mud as a tracer it could be established that both samples were heavily contaminated by mud (70 % ? 80 %).


The well was plugged and abandoned as a dry hole with shows on 2 January 1997.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 33/6-3 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/6-3 S was drilled in the Marulk Basin in the Northern North Sea in order to test the extension of the 34/4-10 oil discovery across a saddle point to a structural high in the south-west. The objective was to evaluate sandstones in the Statfjord Formation, the Beta Statfjord South prospect. The well was planned as a near-HPHT well.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 33/6-3 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Songa Delta on 17 April 2012 and drilled to TD at 4444 m (4200 m TVD) 65 m into the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. The well was drilled directionally (S-shaped well with a sail angle through the 12 1/4” interval (2496 to 4015 m) of approximately 38.5 deg. The well was drilled with seawater down to 1364 m, with Carbo-Sea oil based mud from 1364 m to 2496.5 m, and with Magma-Teq oil based mud from 2496.5 m to TD.


Top of the Statfjord Formation (primary target) was penetrated at 4266 m (4023 m TVD), 6m TVD shallower than prognosis. The Lunde Formation (Hegre Group) was recorded at 4379 m (4135.2 m TVD). The petrophysical interpretation of the logging data recorded a gross Statfjord Formation reservoir of 112.5 m with 35.9 m net water bearing reservoir (average porosity of 13.0% and average SW of 96.7%). The only shows recorded in the well were poor oil shows in cuttings and two sidewall cores, all in the Statfjord Formation sandstones from 4230 m to 4376 m.  Formation pressure and temperature data confirmed the central fault terrace was not in the HPHT regime and that it was in a lower pressure regime to the 34/4-11 and 34/4-13S fault terraces.


No conventional cores were cut in the well. Six RCI formation fluid samples were acquired at the top of the Statfjord Formation (at 4299 m); all were confirmed by laboratory analysis to be formation water.


The well was permanently abandoned on 24 July 2012 as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 33/6-4
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/6-4 was drilled on the Penguin Ridge between the Makrell Horst and the Marulk Basin in the Northern North Sea. The objective was to test the Kakelborg prospect, an intra-Lista Formation sandstone reservoir interpreted as fan deposits of a channel system prograding from the west across the East Shetland Basin. The fan deposits were supported by an AVO-class III anomaly response.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 33/6-4 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Borgland Dolphin on 6 July 2012 and drilled to TD at 1845 m in the Late Cretaceous Jorsalfare Formation. A 9 7/8” pilot hole was drilled from TD in 36” section at 425 m to 650 m to check for shallow gas. No shallow gas was seen. The well was drilled with seawater and sweeps down to 650 m and with Aqua-Drill glycol mud from 650 m to TD.


The Lista Formation was encountered at 1746 m, 6 m shallow to prognosis. The Intra-Lista Formation sandstones were not present and no hydrocarbon shows or anomalous gas values seen when penetrating the Lista Formation. The AVO response observed in the seismic dataset was interpreted as the result of an interference effect where two class IV responses (a hard basal-Lista shale in combination a hard Top Shetland) generated an AVO-class III anomaly. The anomalous seismic response is not observed in any of the neighbouring wells.


Due to lack of reservoir and no shows of hydrocarbons, the logging was limited to LWD and VSP on wireline. No cores were cut and no wire line fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 3 August 2014 as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 33/6-5 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/6-5 S was drilled to test the Tail prospect on the Tampen Spur in the North Sea. The primary objective was to prove presence and commercial volumes of movable hydrocarbons in the Jurassic sandstones of the Rannoch Formation.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 33/6-5 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Yantai on 26 August 2021 and drilled to TD at 3515 m in the Early Jurassic Drake Formation. The top hole was first drilled as a 9 7/8" hole down to 500 m to check for shallow gas. No shallow hazards were encountered, and the hole was opened to 26". After running the 20" surface casing, the well was suspended on 1 September when the rig moved to the nearby Dugong discovery for an appraisal well test. The rig returned on 25 September and the operations resumed. The well was drilled S-shaped, vertical through the target reservoir. Operations proceeded without significant problems. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 500 m, with Glydril mud from 500 m to 1302 m, and with Rheguard oil-based mud from 1302 m to TD.


The target Rannoch Formation was penetrated at 3357 m. It consisted of 91.4 m gross sandstone with limestone stringers. XPT pressure points were taken with good results and identified two, possibly three different pressure zones: the Rannoch Formation sandstone, the Tarbert Formation sandstone and the Intra Draupne Formation sandstone. The reservoir properties in Rannoch/Tarbert are fair to good (porosity average = 19% from log analysis). The Intra-Draupne sandstone have medium reservoir properties (porosity average = 16% from log analysis). All three sandstones are water wet and there were no oil shows above the OBM.


No cores were cut. MDT fluid samples were taken at 3322.7 m (Intra Draupne sandstone), 3360 m (Rannoch), 3402.2 m (Rannoch). All samples recovered water.


The well was permanently abandoned on 16.October 2021 as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 33/9-1
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/9-1 was drilled on the Statfjord structure. It was the first appraisal well on the structure after well 33/12-1 had discovered oil there in 1973-1974. The primary objective was to test sandstones in the Middle Jurassic Brent Group.
                


The well is reference well for the Amundsen, Burton, Cook, Drake, Broom, Rannoch, Etive, Tarbert, Heather, and Draupne formations.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 33/9-1 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Norskald on 2 April 1974 and drilled to TD at 3126 m in Late Triassic sediments of the Statfjord Group.
                


The target Middle Jurassic Brent Group, Tarbert Formation came in at 2464 m and was oil-bearing down to the OWC at 2584 m in the Etive Formation. The Brent reservoir has 145 m gross pay and 124 m net oil pay. Porosities range from 13.0 to 35.9 percent with the overall average porosity being 25 percent. Average water saturation is 18 percent. Cores taken near top of the reservoir showed porosities up to 37% and permeabilities as high as 4.1 darcy. The Statfjord Group sandstone was penetrated at 2923 m. Statfjord Group sandstone was water wet as expected from the structural position of this well. The sands, however, had very good reservoir qualities with average porosity of 22 percent as calculated from the CPI log.


Two cores were cut in the Tarbert Formation from 2469.2 to 2499.4 m with 18 m recovery (60%) of the total cored interval. No fluid samples were taken on wire line.


The well was permanently abandoned on 4 June 1974 as an oil appraisal.


Testing




Three drill stem tests were performed in the Brent Group.


DST 1 tested the interval 2614.9 to 2616.4 m in the Rannoch Formation. The test produced up to 2226 m3 water /day through a 5/4" choke.


DST 2 tested the interval 2506.1 to 2507.3 m in the Ness Formation. The test produced 220 Sm3 oil /day through a 1/4" choke. The GOR was 142 Sm3/Sm3, the oil gravity was 37.8 °API, and the gas gravity was 0.661.


DST 3 tested the interval 2464.6 to 2473.8 m in the Tarbert Formation. The test produced 230 Sm3 oil /day through a 1/4" choke. The GOR was 161 Sm3/Sm3, the oil gravity was 38.6 °API, and the gas gravity was 0.691.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 33/9-4
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/9-4 was drilled on the Statfjord structure on Tampen Spur in the northern North Sea. The primary objective was to test the northern extension of the Statfjord discovery in the Brent Group.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 33/9-4 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Norskald on 30 July 1975 and drilled to TD at 3076 m in the Triassic Hegre Group. No significant problem was encountered in the operations. The well was drilled with seawater and spud mud down to 488 m and with Lignosulphonate mud from 488 m to TD.


The objective Brent Group was encountered at 2554.5 meters, 33.9 meters high to prognosis. Measured core porosities in the Brent Group averaged 26 percent. Horizontal liquid permeability ranged from 0.05 to 1100.5 milliDarcy and averaged 2155 milliDarcy. The Brent Group was oil filled down to the oil-water contact at 2611.5 m. This is 2 m deeper than on the southern part of Statfjord Field and constitute an in-well gross oil column of 57 m of which 37 m was calculated as net reservoir with 25.4% average porosity and 24.2% average water saturation. Apart from shows in the oil bearing section an oil show was described on a sidewall core at 2618 m.


Continuous coring was carried out from within the overlying Middle Jurassic shales through the base of the oil/water contact in the Brent sands, from 2547.2 to 2612.5 meters. Of the 56.7 meters cut by nine cores, 50.7 meters (89 percent) was recovered. No fluid sample was taken on wire line.


The well was permanently abandoned on 17 September as an oil appraisal well.


Testing




Two drill stem tests were conducted.
                


DST 1 tested the interval 2608 to 2610 m, just above the oil-water contact. This test produced 123 Sm3 oil with 1% bottom sediments and water /day through a 14/64" choke. The GOR was 115.6 Sm3/Sm3, the oil gravity was 38.0 °API, and the gas gravity was 0.682 (air = 1). The bottom hole temperature in this test was 98.9 °C.


DST 2 tested the interval 2555 to 2560 m. This test produced 187 Sm3 oil with no bottom sediments and water /day through a 16/32" choke. The GOR was 151 Sm3/Sm3, the oil gravity was 38.3 °API, and the gas gravity was 0.684 (air = 1). The bottom hole temperature in this test was 98.3 °C. On maximum choke (48/64"), DST 2 produced 1164 Sm3 oil /day.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 33/9-5
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/9-5 was drilled on the northern part of the Statfjord structure on Tampen Spur in the northern North Sea. The objective was to appraise the northern extension of the Statfjord Field with the Brent Group as primary target. The Brent Group had previously proved oil bearing in wells 33/9-3 and 33/9-4 on the northern part of the structure. The well was positioned to penetrate the upper Brent reservoir at 2522 m MSL, 62 meters above the known field water level. The Statfjord Group was a secondary objective.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 33/9-5 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation  Ross Rig on 27 October 1975 and drilled to TD at 3157 m in Late Triassic sediments of the Statfjord Group.
                


Top Brent Group (Tarbert Formation) was encountered at 2605 m, 57.8 m low to prognosis. As with other Brent Group oil wells in the Statfjord Field, high total gas readings (70 000 ppm) were encountered when the reservoir was penetrated. Using the field pay cut off value of 65% water saturation, the oil/water contact depth as measured from the CPI log is 2616.4 m (2591.4  MSL), which is 7.3 meters deeper than the main field water level. The resulting gross pay interval is 11.6 meters of which 100% is net pay using CPI field cut off values of 65% water saturation, 40% v-clay or 12% porosity. Average CPI measured porosity in the pay section is 22.1% and water saturation is 37%.


The Statfjord Group was penetrated at 2998 m and was found water wet.


One core was cut from 2611.5 to 2628.35 m with 88.7% recovery. The core to log depth shift was estimated to be -2.3 m. FIT fluid samples were taken at 2624.5 m (failed test), 2617.0 m (water with trace oil), 2611.0 m (water with trace mud), 2609.0 m (water with trace mud), 2607.0 m (35.8 °API oil and water), 2650.0 m (water with trace mud), and 2607.8 m (water only).


The well was permanently abandoned on 1 January 1976 as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 33/9-6
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/9-6 was drilled ca 3 km east of the UK border on the 9-Delta prospect located on the regional Murchison structural trend, which extends across the northern portion of block 33/9.


The well was the first wildcat in the Norwegian sector of the Murchison trend.


The primary objective was the Brent Group sand, which is oil reservoir of the adjacent Murchison Field. The well was drilled near the crest of the structure with a planned total depth of 3300 m, approximately 30 m into the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 33/9-6 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Dyvi Alpha on 23 June 1976 and drilled to TD at 3354 m in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation.
                


The Tertiary consisted primarily of clays, siltstones, and minor sands. The tuffaceous red claystone typical of the Paleocene was encountered slightly above the log pick at 1669.5 m. The sandy basal portion of the Paleocene was not well developed in 33/9-6. Oil and gas shows have occurred in this zone in both Statfjord and Murchison Field wells; however, no-shows were observed in 33/9-6. The objective Brent Group was encountered at 2995 m, 7.5 m low to prognosis. The sand was described as clear to white, fine grained and very micaceous. Porosity was poor to fair; and poor to fair oil shows and scattered thin zones of bleeding oil were described down to 3023 m. No shows occurred below 3023 m. Schlumberger Coriband Log analysis and core data indicated 24.5 meters of gross pay and 13.5 meters of net pay, and an oil/water contact of 3019.5 m. Based on this reserves for the horst block alone were estimated at only ca 900000 Sm3 oil due to the poor reservoir quality in the oil column. By assuming the same oil/water contact for the graben area to the east additional reserves of ca 7900000 Sm3 oil was estimated.
                


Two cores were cut in the Brent Group reservoir from 2997 m to 3033.4 m. Four FIT'S were run at 2998.5 m, 2996.5 m, 2997.5 m, and 2995.5 m in the Brent reservoir to evaluate the shows. The FIT's were unsuccessful in recovering quantitative formation fluid. With the exception of FIT No. 2, which recovered a trace of oil, only mud filtrate, mud, and a trace of gas were recovered. The NaCl content of recovered fluid ranged from 3300 - 5280 ppm which was consistent with the salinity of the drilling mud.
                


The well was permanently abandoned on 31 August 1976. It is classified as a minor oil discovery.


Testing




A drill stem test was attempted, but terminated without results due to mechanical problems.

Well: 33/9-7
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/9-7, was drilled on the 33/9-Alpha prospect, 2.5 km east of the Statfjord Field in the Tampen Spur area in the northern North Sea. The primary objective was to test a part of the Brent-Statfjord trend separated from the Statfjord Field to the west by a structural saddle. The primary target was the Brent Group sandstones. Sandstones within the Statfjord Group was a secondary target.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 33/9-7 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Dyvi Alpha on 11 September 1976 and drilled to TD at 3127 m in the Statfjord Group.
                


Good oil and gas shows seen in a 50-meter thick sequence of interbedded sands and claystones in the lower portion of the Paleocene from 1770-1820 m. The sands although not apparently continuous, were oil stained and had good gas shows throughout the interval. Log evaluation was not practical due to washing out resulting in excessive hole sizes. The Brent Group sandstones came in sandstones at 2461 m. There was 160 m net sand with average 27% porosity. The sands were oil-filled down to a section of claystones, coals and minor sands at 2520 m. An OWC was inferred at 2533 m. No shows were observed in the Statfjord sands, but the logs indicated scattered residual oil.


A total of 103.33 m core (86% recovery) was cut in nine cores in the interval 2465 to 2597 m in the Brent Group. No fluid samples were taken on wire line.


The well was permanently abandoned on 7 November 1976 as an oil discovery.


Testing




Three drill stem tests were carried out.


DST 1 tested the interval 2489.9 m in the Brent Group. This test flowed 1080 m3 oil/day through a 3/4" choke. The GOR was 93 Sm3/Sm3, the oil gravity was 37.7 °API and the gas gravity was 0.69 (air = 1).


DST 2 and 3 both tested the interval 1780 to 1800 m in the Lista Formation. In DST 2, perforations were plugged and no fluid was produced to the surface. In DST 3, the formation produced fluid at a rate of 114 m3/day through a 1/2" choke. The fluid consisted of 70% free water, 27% emulsion, 2% bottom sediments, and 1% oil. The high water cut in this test could be a result of poor isolation of the zone due to excessively caved hole.

Well: 33/9-8
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/9-8, was drilled on a prospect north of the main Statfjord Field in the Tampen Spur area in the northern North Sea. The primary objective was to test sandstones in the Brent Group. Secondary objective was the Statfjord Group


Operations and results


Wildcat well 33/9-8 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Bergen on 11 November 1976 and drilled to TD at 3085 m in the Statfjord Group. The original hole was abandoned at 2974 with stuck pipe. A technical sidetrack was kicked off from 2533 m. Top Brent Group is 6 m deeper in the sidetrack compared to in the original hole.
                


The sand and sand stringers generally associated with the lower portion of the Paleocene in the area were not developed in 33/9-8. An oil filled Intra-Draupne Formation sandstone was penetrated at 2670 m. This was the first encounter of Late Jurassic sandstone in the 037 License area. The gross thickness of this sandstone is 45.8 m. Net sand was found to be 34.8 m with 27% average porosity, based on log analysis. The whole sand was oil filled down to top Heather Formation at 2716 m. The Brent Group sandstones was encountered at 2740 m with oil down to the OWC at 2741.5 m. Gross thickness of the Brent Group sandstones was 140.3 m. Net sand was found to be 124 m with 22% average porosity. The secondary objective Statfjord Group was water wet without shows.


Three cores were cut in Late Jurassic Viking Group the interval 2670 to 2724.8 m (54.8m). The core recoveries were 2670 to 2671.27 m (7%), 2688.5 to 2706.26 m (97%), and 2706.8 to 2724.5 m (98%) for cores one, two, and three, respectively. The cores were cut in the original hole. Add six meters to the core depths to match with the well logs, which were run in the sidetrack. No fluid samples were taken on wire line


The well was permanently abandoned on 18 February 1977 as an oil discovery.


Testing




Three drill stem tests were performed.
                


DST 1 tested the interval 2745.5 to 2748.5 m in the Brent Group. The aim was to locate the oil/water contact. The test produced 1313 m3 water/day through a 3/4" choke. A trace of oil appeared with the water near the end of the test. The bottom hole temperature in the test was 99.2 °C


DST 2 tested the interval 2737.0 to 2741.5 m across the border between the Heather Formation and the Brent Group. The aim was to locate the oil/water contact. This test produced 1003 Sm3 oil and 32900 Sm3 gas /day through a 3/4" choke. The GOR was 33 Sm3/Sm3, the oil gravity was 37.4 °API and the gas gravity was 0.752 (air = 1). The bottom hole temperature in the test was 100 °C.


DST 3 tested the interval 2683.0 to 2686.0 m in Intra Draupne Formation sandstone. The test produced 1997 Sm3 oil and 80730 Sm3 gas /day through a 3/4" choke. The GOR was 40 Sm3/Sm3, the oil gravity was 38.1 °API, and the gas gravity was 0.757 (air = 1). The bottom hole temperature in the test was 95.6 °C.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 33/9-9
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/9-9 was drilled in the northern part of the Statfjord field, about 1.6 km southeast of 33/9-3 well on the Tampen Spur in the northern North Sea. The objectives were to provide structural and stratigraphic control on the Brent reservoirs, and to provide stratigraphic control and to establish an oil/water contact for the Statfjord reservoir.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 33/9-9 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Borgny Dolphin on 27 July 1977 and drilled to TD at 3100 m in Late Triassic sediments in the Statfjord Formation. The well was drilled with seawater down to 486 m and with a seawater/lignosulphonate mud system from 486 m to 1993 m. At 1993 m, TD in the 17 1/2" section, the hole was displaced to a freshwater/Lignosulphonate mud system. At the same point diesel was added to free the 13 3/8" casing which had become differentially stuck. After that the mud contained initially 5% diesel decreasing to traces of diesel at to 2489 m. From 2489 m to final TD the freshwater/Lignosulphonate mud system was without measurable diesel.


No hydrocarbon shows were reported above the Brent Group. The Brent Group was found at 2413 m, 77.5 m deeper than prognosed 44.0 m thinner than anticipated in comparison to 33/9-3. Good oil shows were encountered at the top of the Brent Formation and continued throughout the reservoir down to top Dunlin Group at 2504 m. The entire Brent Group was oil-filled and it was above the field oil/water contact of 2609.1 m (2584.1 MSL). Log calculations showed that of the 87.0 m of gross oil section 84.6 m was net sand with 27.5% average porosity and 13.1% average water saturation. The Dunlin Group came in at 2504 m and log interpretation indicated a 23.2 m gross oil bearing reservoir between 2528.4 and 2551.6 m with 17.9 m net oil sand. The interval had 20.2% average porosity and 34.6% water saturation. Oil shows were reported from ditch samples and side wall cores in the Dunlin sand between 2535 and 2575 m. No OWC was established in the Dunlin Group. It was assumed that Brent and Dunlin had a common OWC at 2609.1 m (2584.1 MSL), outside well position. The Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation was penetrated at 2715.0, only 5.0 m deep to prognosis confirming that the Statfjord seismic reflector is a reliable mapping horizon. Good oil shows were reported from the top down to about 2850.0 m. The lowest potential pay sand indicated on the CPI log occurs between 2847.5 and 2852.5 m, but a test in this interval, DST No. 2, produced water with only trace oil. The anticipated oil/water contact was not found. The lowest-known-oil in the well at 2815.0 m (2790.0 m MSL) is 13.1 m above the lowest-known-oil previously established in the 33/12-2, which falls within a section of tight sands and shales in 33/9-9.
                


A total of 23 cores were cut in the well. Cores no 1 to 8 were taken through the Brent reservoir and into the shaly top of Dunlin, while cores no 9 to 23 were cut in the Statfjord Formation. A significant error in core depth is noted for the first 16 cores. For these 11.3 m must be added to the registered core depths in order to match with the logger's depth. The last seven cores had core-log mismatch within +/- 2 m.


The well was permanently abandoned on 17 November 1977 as n oil and gas appraisal well.


Testing




Six separate zones were successfully tested, requiring a total of nine attempts. The purpose of the tests was to obtain information from six separate zones in the Brent, Dunlin and Statfjord Sands in order to further evaluate the reservoirs. The tests for the first two zones were designed primarily for production data, bottom hole pressures and formation fluid samples, with sustained sand production expected only if very thin unconsolidated sand stringers were present. The last four zones where sand bonding was weak, as calculated from the well log data, had the additional test requirement of measuring the oil rate at which the formation sand broke down.
                


DST 1 in the interval 2847.5 to 2852.5 m in the Statfjord Formation was a misrun.


DST 2 in the interval 2847.5 to 2852.5 m in the Statfjord Formation produced 215 Sm3 water and only trace oil /day through a 3/4" choke. The recorded bottom hole temperature was 91.1 deg C. Sand was produced throughout the test, at rates from 1200 to 300 pounds/thousand barrels (ptb)
                


DST 3 in the interval 2800.0 m to 2803.5 m in the Statfjord Formation produced in the final flow period 254 Sm3 oil /day through a 1/4" choke. The GOR was 82 Sm3/Sm3 and the oil gravity was 39.0 deg API. The recorded bottom hole temperature was 86.1 deg C. After the initial cleanup flow no sand was produced.


DST 4 in the interval 2742.0 m to 2745.0 m in the Statfjord Formation was a misrun.


DST 5 in the interval 2742.0 m to 2745.0 m in the Statfjord Formation produced in the final flow period 513 Sm3 oil /day through a 5/16" choke. The GOR was 93 Sm3/Sm3 and the oil gravity was 38.7 deg API. The recorded bottom hole temperature was 89.4 deg C. Sand was produced after each rate change (20 ptb), but cleaned up rapidly. Sand began producing more or less continuously, in bursts, on 5/8" choke (40 ptb) indicating formation was breaking down.


DST 6 in the interval 2742.0 m to 2745.0 m in the Statfjord Formation produced in the final flow period 299 Sm3 oil /day through a 1/4" choke. The GOR was 129 Sm3/Sm3 and the oil gravity was 38.6 deg API. The recorded bottom hole temperature was 89 deg C.No sand was observed other than a few grains upon initial cleanup on 7/16" choke.


DST 7 in the interval 2531.0 m to 2537.0 m in the Dunlin Group produced in the final flow period 442 Sm3 oil /day through a 23/64" choke. The GOR was 117 Sm3/Sm3 and the oil gravity was 34.4 deg API. The recorded bottom hole temperature was 82.8 deg C. On 1 1/4" choke sand production was observed on a continuous basis at about 120 ptb.


DST 8 in the interval 2458.0 m to 2460.7 m in the Brent Group produced in the final flow period 525 Sm3 oil /day through a 24/64" choke. The GOR was 144 Sm3/Sm3 and the oil gravity was 37.6 deg API (measured in the first flow period). The recorded bottom hole temperature was 80.1 deg C. Only small amounts of sand were produced.


DST 9 in the interval 2426.0 m to 2432.8 m in the Brent Group produced in the final flow period 416 Sm3 oil /day through a 22/64" choke. The GOR was 170 Sm3/Sm3 and the oil gravity was 38.5 deg API (measured in the first flow period). No temperature was recorded due to malfunction in the temperature gauge. Small amounts of sand were produced throughout the test. No measurable sand was produced on the highest flow rate (50/64" adjustable choke).

Well: 33/9-10
Wellbore history
 





General


Wildcat well 33/9-10 is located on the Tampen Spur North of the Murchinson Field. The Middle Jurassic Brent sand was the primary objective with the Early Jurassic Statfjord sand as a secondary objective. Planned TD was 3695 m, interpreted to be 30 m into the Statfjord Formation.
                


Operations and results


Wildcat well 33/9-10 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Fernstar on 7 April 1978 and drilled to TD at 3715 m in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation. The well was drilled with Spud down to 516 m, with seawater/FCL polymer mud from 516 to 1820 m, with lignosulphonate/fresh water from1820 to 3491 m, and with Qbroxin/CC-16/fresh water from 3491 m to TD. Spots of diesel and protectomagic (water or diesel-dispersed asphalt) was added to the mud, beginning at 1820 m. From 1820 m, oil in the mud was reported at contents varying between 3% and 20%.
                


The electric log pick of the top of the Early Cretaceous Cromer Knoll Group was taken at 3113 m, giving an Early Cretaceous thickness of 146.8 m. The Early Cretaceous consisted of 20.3 m of Barremian limestone at the base with red marl interbedded with the overlying claystone section.
                


Top Late Jurassic Viking Group was picked at 3259.8 m, 15.7 m high to prognosis. The thickness was 88.2 m of which the upper 69.2 m was the Draupne Formation and the lower 19 m was the Heather Formation. The lithology of the Viking Group was grey to dark grey, silty claystone.
                


The primary objective Brent Group was penetrated at 3348 m, 37.5 m high to prognosis. The sandstone was argillaceous, medium grained, and had fair to poor porosity. Of the expected 140 m of Brent Group, only 67.5 m was found. Of this 37 m was net sand. The Brent Group was water bearing. No shows were seen in the ditch samples. One core was cut from 3358 m to 3376 m. Very poor shows were observed in the core, but electric logs and Schlumberger Coriband analysis indicated the Brent Formation to be water wet. The shows in the core most likely came from flushing of the core with diesel and protectomagic mud. No residual oil was measured in the core plugs.
                


Top Dunlin Group was found at 3415.5 m, 110 m high to prognosis. It was 84.5 m thick versus the prognosed 140 m.
                


The secondary objective Statfjord Formation came in at 3500 m, 165.5 m high to prognosis. The Statfjord sands were tight with calcareous cement. Electric logs and lack of shows proved the formation to be water wet. Drilling went on in order to reach and identify the seismic reflector originally mapped as the Near Top Statfjord event. Twenty meters net of very calcareous sandstone stringers between 3635 m and TD appeared to account for this reflector. The well was permanently abandoned as a dry well on 12 June 1978.
                


Testing
                


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 33/9-11
Wellbore history
 





General


Wildcat well 33/9-11 was drilled to test the 33/9-Epsilon prospect 6 kilometres north of the 33/9-Beta oil discovery and 10 kilometres northeast of the Murchison Field (UK). The Epsilon structure is a northwest tilted fault block and is expressed as a topographic high at the Kimmerian Unconformity surface. The primary objective was to test the hydrocarbon potential in the Middle Jurassic Brent Sand. The Early Jurassic Statfjord Sand was secondary objective.


Operations and results


Exploration well 33/9-11 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Fernstar on 17 June 1978. The spud location turned out to be in a 25 m diameter crater in the sea floor. Due to problems with tilting of the temporary guide base two unsuccessful spuds were made before the third and successful spud was made with a modified guide base on 24 June 1978. Final position refers to this hole. The well was drilled with seawater and gel down to 820 m, with KCl polymer mud from 820 m to 1870 m, and with a fresh water/lignosulfonate mud from 1870 m to TD. Diesel and Protectomagic was spotted below 820 m, and from this depth the mud is reported to contain between 4 and 12 % oil. The well was drilled to TD at 3528 m, 91 m into the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation.


Grey clays and claystone dominated the Tertiary except for the sands in the intervals, 989 to 1034m and 1205 to 1225m. In the Paleocene Balder Formation typical tuffaceous grey and red claystone were present and were also observed above and below the Balder. The Late Cretaceous Shetland Group was comprised of grey and brown claystone and siltstones with only minor sands and carbonates. The electric log pick of the top of the Early Cretaceous Cromer Knoll Group was taken at 3037.8 m. The Early Cretaceous was 58 m thick and consisted of 8.6 m of Barremian limestone at the base and claystone with interbedded marls in the overlying section.


The Late Jurassic Viking Group was encountered at 3096.2 m, 28.8 m high to prognosis. Of the 29.8 m thick shale section the upper 2.8 m was the Draupne Formation and the lower 27 m was the Heather Formation.
                


The primary objective Brent Group came in at 3126 m. It was 149.6 m thick and had 102 m net sand. The sandstone was argillaceous; medium grained and had fair porosity. Both porosity and permeability were better than in the 33/9-10 well. Brent was water bearing and no shows were seen in the ditch samples. One core was cut from 3134 m to 3152 m. Weak shows were observed in the core in the top of the reservoir from 3134 m to 3136 m, but electric logs indicated the Brent Formation to be water wet. The shows were explained by flushing of the core with diesel and Protectomagic mud. No residual oil was measured in the core plugs. Core porosity averaged 22.2 percent and horizontal liquid permeability averaged 370 mD, ranging up to 1874 mD.
                


Top Dunlin Group was penetrated at 3275.6 m. It consisted of 161 m silty, micaceous claystone belonging to the Drake Formation. The Statfjord Formation came in at 3436.6 m. The Statfjord sand was kaolinitic, coarse and had fair to good porosity but with several tight calcareous-cemented sand streaks. No shows were seen in the samples and electric log analysis confirmed the Statfjord Formation to be water wet.
                


The well was permanently abandoned as dry on 28 August 1978.
                


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 33/9-12
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/9-12 was drilled on the Statfjord Øst Discovery on Tampen Spur in the North Sea. The field was discovered in late 1976 by well 33/9-7, which proved oil in the upper portion of the Brent Group. The well 34/7-5, which was drilled on the northerly segment of the structure, penetrated an oil-bearing Brent section down to the same structural level as seen in well 33/9-7, suggesting communication between the wells. However, neither well was drilled in a location that could demonstrate oil in the major Lower Brent reservoir or allowed a clear definition of the oil water contact.  The objective of well 33/9-12 was to test the Lower Brent Group and to establish the oil-water contact.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 33/9-12 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Ross Isle on 19 June 1987 and drilled to TD at 2959 m in the Triassic Hegre Group. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 360 m, with gypsum/polymer mud from 360 m to 2120 m, and with gel/lignosulphonate mud from 2120 m to TD.


Weak shows in traces of sand was described from 2220 m and down in the Shetland Group. Top Brent Group, Tarbert Formation was penetrated at 2461 m. The Brent Group had a total oil leg of 52.25 metres above the oil-water contact in the Etive formation at 2513.75 m (2491. 75 m TVD MSL). Oil shows continued down to 2530 m; below this depth shows became weak and patchy. The Statoil Group was encountered at 2814 m. It was water wet and pressure measurements showed that the Statfjord formation is not in pressure communication with the Brent group.
                


Three cores were cut in the interval 2467 m to 2566 m in the Brent Group and into the Uppermost Dunlin Group with 95 to 99.7% recovery.  The core-log depth shifts for cores 1, 2, and 3 were -2 m, -4 m and -4.5 m, respectively. A segregated FMT fluid sample was taken at 2464 m. The sample recovered oil and gas.
                


The well was permanently abandoned on 3 August 1987 as an oil appraisal.


Testing




Three drill stem tests were performed in the Brent Group.
                


DST 1 tested the interval 2526.0 to 2538.0 m in the Upper Rannoch Formation. The test produced 795 m3 water /day through a 12.7 mm choke. The DST reservoir temperature was 91.6 °C.


DST 2 tested the interval 2505.0 to 2508.0 m in the Etive Formation. The test produced 113740 Sm3 gas and 1050 Sm3 oil /day through a 14.1 mm choke. The GOR was 111 Sm3/Sm3, the oil density was 0.846 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was 0.725 (air = 1). The DST reservoir temperature was 91.5 °C. At the end of this test the well started producing water. The water cut was approximately 8 % when the well was shut in.


DST 3 tested the interval 2463.0 to 2489.0 m in the Tarbert Formation. The test produced 153880 Sm3 gas and 1470 Sm3 oil /day through a 19.05 mm choke. The GOR was 105 Sm3/Sm3, the oil density was 0.827 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was 0.712 (air = 1). The DST reservoir temperature was 90.0 °C.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 33/9-13 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/9-13 S was drilled on the Statfjord Nord Field on the Tampen Spur area in the North Sea. The primary objective was to prove oil in the Brent Group to the northeast of the 33/9-8 discovery well. Secondary objective was to test the Statfjord Group in a position up-dip of the 33/9-8 location.


Operations and results


Well 33/9-13 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Ross Isle on 14 October 1987 and drilled to TD at 3077 m in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Group. The well location was moved ca 300 m to the south-southwest to avoid a potential shallow gas zone at 381 m. The well was deviated back to the original target position with maximum deviation 34.3° at 1739 m. Shallow gas was encountered at 399.5 m, 399.9m, 404.5 m, and 547 m. No significant problem was encountered in the operations. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis bentonite down to 398 m, with gypsum/polymer mud from 398 m to 2378 m, and with lignosulphonate/bentonite mud from 2378 m to TD.


The Brent Group, Rannoch Formation was encountered at 2726 m and was completely oil filled down-to 2795 m (2720 m TVD) with shows on claystones and siltstones down to top Dunlin Group. The Statfjord Group was encountered at 3003 m and was water filled. Shows were described only within the Brent Group.


Four cores were cut in the Brent and uppermost Dunlin Groups within the interval 2732 - 2828.3 m. No fluid samples were taken on wire line.


The well was permanently abandoned on 24 December 1987 as an oil appraisal well.


Testing




Two Drill Stem Tests were conducted


DST 1.1 tested the interval 2778 to 2787 m (2703 to 2712 TVD). The test produced 122 Sm3 oil and 6960 Sm3 gas /day through a 9.53 mm choke. The GOR was 57 Sm3/Sm3, the oil density was 0.850 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was 0.890 (air = 1). The DST reservoir temperature was 93.1 °C.


DST 1.2 tested the interval 2758 to 2775.2 m + 2778 to 2787 m (2683 to 2700.2 m + 2703 to 2712 TVD). The test produced 642 Sm3 oil and 33139 Sm3 gas /day through a 9.53 mm choke. The GOR was 51.6 Sm3/Sm3, the oil density was 0.838 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was 0.830 (air = 1). The DST reservoir temperature was 93.1 °C.


DST 2 tested the interval 2727 to 2740.7 m (2652 to 2665.7 m TVD). The test produced 815 Sm3 oil and 41640 Sm3 gas /day through a 9.53 mm choke. The GOR was 51 Sm3/Sm3, the oil density was 0.839 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was 0.805 (air = 1). The DST reservoir temperature was 93.0 °C.

Well: 33/9-14
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/9-14 was drilled on the Statfjord Nord Field on Tampen Spur in the North Sea. The primary objective of the well was to verify the lateral and vertical distribution of sand within a thick Volgian sequence and to prove oil below 2690 m MSL in this sequence (deepest oil in Volgian, well 33/9-8). The Brent Group was a secondary target.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 33/9-14 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Bergen and drilled to TD at 2982 m in the Early Jurassic Drake Formation. There were signs of shallow gas from 408 409 m, but the gas bearing sands created no problems. No significant problem was encountered in the operations. The well was drilled with seawater/gel down to 414 m, with gypsum/polymer mud from 414 m to 2670 m, and with gel/lignosulphonate mud from 2670 m to TD.


The reservoir (interpreted as Kimmeridgian age Intra Draupne Formation Sandstone) came in as prognosed at 2674 m. The oil/water contact was taken from the logs to be at 2747 m, while pressure gradients suggest the contact could be five meter higher up. Intermittent weak shows were described down to 2800 m, else no shows were described in the well.  The reservoir properties were very good with porosities up to 30 %. The Brent Group, Ness Formation came in at 2777 m. It was water wet.


Six cores were cut in the Intra Draupne Formation Sandstones and the Brent Group in the interval 2680 to 2879 m. The recovery was generally good except for core 3, for which only 0.5 m was recovered. The core-log depth shift was 3.0 to -3.5 m for all cores. FMT fluid samples were taken at 2757 m and at 2798.4 m.


The well was permanently abandoned on 9 April 1988 as an oil appraisal well.


Testing




Two DST tests were performed in the well.
                


DST 1 tested the interval 2746.8 - 2759.8 m. It produced 1400 m3 water and 8500 Sm3 gas /day through a 15.9 mm choke. Water production declined to 1287 m3/day at the end of the test. At the end of the test 5%, oil was produced with the water. The DST reservoir temperature was 96 °C.


DST 2.1 tested the interval 2718 - 2732 m. It produced 1370 Sm3 oil and 74670 Sm3 gas /day through a 14.3 mm choke. The oil production declined to 1310 Sm3/day at the end of the test. The GOR varied accordingly from 55 to 57 Sm3/Sm3, while oil density and gas gravity is reported as 0.837 g/cm3 and 0.704 (air = 1), respectively. The DST reservoir temperature was 95 °C.


DST 2.2 teste the interval 2718 - 2738 m + 2675 - 2705 m. It produced 1416 Sm3 oil and 58060 Sm3 gas /day through a 14.3 mm choke. The GOR was 41 Sm3/Sm3, the oil density was 0.837 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was 0.703 (air = 1). The DST reservoir temperature was 95 °C.

Well: 33/9-15
Wellbore history
 





General


The 33/9-15 well is located on the northwestern flank of the Tampen Spur geological province, on the western margin of the North Viking Graben. To the north of the well location lies the Statfjord Nord oil field with the main Statfjord oil field to the south and Statfjord Øst to the Southeast.  Well 33/9-15 was drilled in the southern part of Licence PL172.  The primary objective was to evaluate the hydrocarbon potential of a Late Jurassic Intra Draupne Sandstone unit, which was thought to be similar to, or possibly associated with, the nearby Statfjord Nord field.  The secondary objective was to evaluate Middle Jurassic sands of the Brent Group.


Operations and results


The well 33/9-15 was spudded with the semi-submersible rig Sovereign Explorer on 23 April 1992 and drilled to TD at 3007 m in the middle Jurassic Etive Formation. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 416 m and with KCl / Polymer mud from 416 m to TD. Weak shows appeared on cores at the Mime Formation level. A thin oil zone was encountered at the top of the Munin sandstone unit of the Draupne Formation and two additional thin oil zones were seen further down in the Munin sandstone. No shows were seen in the Brent Group. Three RFT fluid samples were taken in the Intra Draupne Formation Sandstone at 2743.5 m, 2783.2 m, and 2829.8 m. They all contained water with trace of oil. The sample from 2829 m contained sufficient oil for analysis, which gave an oil density of 0.859 g/cm3 (33.1 API gravity). Eight cores were cut in the interval 2711 m to 2838 m, two in the Cromer Knoll Group, one from the base Mime Formation and into the upper Draupne Formation and the remaining five in the Draupne Formation.


The well was permanently abandoned on 8 June 1992 as a dry hole with oil shows.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed

Well: 33/9-16
Wellbore history
 





General


Exploration well 33/9-16 well is located 1.8 km south of the recently drilled 33/9-15 well. It is located just north of Statfjord East and south of Statfjord North in the southern part of License PL 172 updip from the 33/9-15 well and within the same seismically defined Intra Draupne deposits of Volgian age. The primary objective was to evaluate the hydrocarbon potential of the Late Jurassic (Volgian) Intra-Draupne Formation sandstone ("Munin sandstone unit") above the oil/water contact (2719 m subsea), found in the 33/9-15 well. The secondary objective was to evaluate the Middle Jurassic sands of the Brent Group.


Operations and results


Well 33/9-16 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation "Ross Isle" on 28 November 1992 and drilled to TD at 2870 m in the Middle Jurassic Ness Formation. The well was drilled water based with sea water and hi-vis pills down to 407 m, sea water and PHB/PAC from 407 m to 1106 m, and with KCl/PHPA/PHB/PAC mud from 1106 m to TD.


In the Upper Jurassic, the Intra Draupne Formation Sandstone was found as sandstones interbedded with thin siltstones. A 4.3 m zone with oil shows was encountered in the uppermost part of this unit based on shows while drilling and MWD. Three cores were cut in the Draupne Formation. Except for the top meter, the entire Intra Draupne sandstone unit was cored. The top 4 m of the core consisted of a sandstone with good porosity and oil shows.
                


In the Middle Jurassic Brent Group, no oil shows were observed in sandstones of the Tarbert and Ness Formations and as a result no cores were cut. An RFT and an MDT sample were taken at 2685 and 2684.5 m respectively and contained water and some gas but only traces of oil. A second MDT sample from 2713 m in the Intra Draupne Formation Sandstone contained water, slight traces of oil, and negligible gas. No wire line samples were taken in the Brent Group.


The well was permanently abandoned as a dry hole with oil shows on 20 January 1993.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 33/9-17
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/9-17 is located immediately north of the Statfjord field, northwest of the Statfjord Nord field with the Murchison field to the west.


The primary objective of the well was to evaluate the hydrocarbon potential of intra-Draupne sandstone informally named the Munin sandstone unit. It was designed to find commercial hydrocarbons in a structural/stratigraphic play above 3080 meters sub-sea, the interpreted oil/water contact. The secondary objective was to evaluate the Middle Jurassic sandstones of the Brent Group.


Operations and results


Well 33/9-17 was spudded on 2 April 1994 with the semi-submersible rig Treasure Saga and reached a total driller's depth of 3233 m RKB in the Middle Jurassic Brent Group. The well was drilled with seawater and swept with high viscosity mud down to the 12 1/4" section, while KCl/polymer/Glycol mud was used when drilling the 12 1/4" section and to TD.


The Munin sandstone unit (3050 - 3131m) was mostly water bearing with localized hydrocarbon shows. Average water saturation within the reservoir is 89.2%. The unit consisted of 47.3 meters of net reservoir out of a gross interval of 81 meters (N/G = 58.4%). The net reservoir was of excellent quality. Average Munin porosity was 22.6% and permeability was generally over l Darcy. The Brent Group (3187 -3233m) has 22.9 meters of good quality reservoir rock from a gross sandstone thickness of 37 meters, but is water bearing. Average porosity for the reservoir rock is 19.7%.


None of the analysed potential source rocks of this well are within the oil window and only limited early generation of hydrocarbons has taken place. The Viking Group claystones do, however, seem to have generated some hydrocarbons. These hydrocarbon products appear to be fairly sulphur-rich.


The best source rocks found in well 33/9-17 are represented by the claystones in the upper and lower sections of the Draupne Formation and in the Munin sandstone unit. These are very rich source rocks and are oil prone. The lower section of the Draupne Formation appears to contain an almost lacustrine assemblage of kerogen.


The Brent Group contains TOC-rich claystones, but they appear to be more gas prone although they could have some oil potential. The Tertiary and Cretaceous sections have at best a fair potential for gas generation although the base of the Cromer Knoll Group grades to the Draupne Formation and could be said to have some potential for oil generation.


Three cores were cut through the Mime Formation of the Cromer Knoll Group and the Draupne Formation of the Viking Group. The last core penetrated some 13 m of the Munin sandstone unit. The Munin sandstone cores had good porosity. An RFT sample taken at 3087 m (logger’s depth) in the Munin sandstone unit contained water. RFT formation pressures were obtained in Draupne (Munin sandstone unit), Tarbert Formation and Ness Formation. Traces of oil shows were observed in sandy laminations within claystones of the Draupne Group immediately overlying the Munin sandstones. In the Middle Jurassic Brent Group, no oil shows were observed in sandstones of the Tarbert and Ness Formations and no cores were cut here.


Well 33/9-17 discovered only traces of hydrocarbons within the Munin sandstone unit. These hydrocarbons were not detected during drilling (MWD) but are evident within the whole core (core depths 3045m and 3055m, measured depths 3050.5mand 3060.5m). Petrophysical analysis confirmed the existence of low oil saturations within the Munin sandstone unit.


The well was plugged and abandoned as a dry hole with oil shows in the Munin sandstone unit on 4 May 1994.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 33/9-19 A
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/9-19 A is situated in the Tampen Spur area. The well 33/9-19 A was drilled to the Statfjord Nord Nordøst Segment (SFNNÏS) of the Statfjord Field. This segment lies at the north-eastern extension of the Statfjord North Field structure in both blocks 33/9 and 34/17. The primary objective for the well 33/9-19 A was to identify the level of oil-water contact or a deep "oil-down-to-situation" within the Nord Nordøst Segment. The secondary objective was to test the SFNNÏS Brent prospect on the north-western side of the Nordøst Segment main fault.
                


Operations and results


The well 33/9-19A was spudded on the 23 of July 1996, using the semi-submersible installation "Transocean Wildcat". The well 33/9-19 A was sidetracked from well 33/9-19 S in a north- north-western direction. Well 33/9-19 A was drilled from kick off at 2000 m to TD in the Lower Jurassic Dunlin Group at 3514 m (3057.1 m TVD RKB). The section from 2000 - 3514 m (1999.9 - 3057.0 m TVD RKB) was drilled in one bit run with Ancovert Oil based mud.
                


Repeated overpull and short stuck events made the logging-run operations difficult. Reservoir characteristics were similar to the Statfjord Nord Field. The oil-water contact was in the Rannoch Formation at approximately 2942 m (2735 m TVD RKB). The Brent Group sands were not encountered northwest of the main fault. TD was at 3514 m (3032 m TVD RKB) in the Dunlin Group. No fluid samples were collected and no coring was performed in the well.


The well was permanently plugged and abandoned as an oil appraisal well on 9 August 1996.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 33/9-22 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/9-22 S was drilled to test the Goanna prospect on the Tampen Spur between the Snorre and Statfjord fields in the North Sea. The primary objective was to test the hydrocarbon potential in Late Jurassic Intra-Draupne Formation sandstone. A secondary objective was to test possible hydrocarbon bearing sandstone in the Paleocene Heimdal Formation.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 33/9-22 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Bergen on 26 August 2017 and drilled to TD at 2730 m (2715 m TVD) m in the Late Jurassic Draupne Formation. Operations proceeded without significant problems. The well was drilled with seawater and bentonite sweeps down to 1102 m, and with Innovert NS oil-based mud from 1102 m
                

down to TD.
                


The Heimdal Formation sandstone was penetrated from 1858 to 1897 m and the Intra Draupne Formation sandstone from 2672 to 2721 m. Both targets were dry without shows.
                


No cores were cut. No fluid sample was taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 17 September as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 33/12-2
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/12-2 was drilled in the Tampen Spur area as one of the first wells in the Statfjord Field area. Primary target of the well was the Early Jurassic Statfjord Group, which was known to be productive in Brent Field located about 20 km to the southwest in the U.K. offshore. The Statfjord Formation was water wet in the 33/12-1 and 33/9-1 tests. The 33/12-2 wildcat was located to encounter the Statfjord Formation approximately 200 m high to the 33/12-1 well. The Middle Jurassic Brent Formation was prognosed to be erosionally thin or absent. Triassic, Permian and Devonian reservoirs were secondary targets. Planned total depth was 4572 m (15000 ft.), believed to be sufficient to reach Devonian age rocks or "Petroleum Basement". The well was one of the three deep tests called for by the License 037 work obligation.
                


The well is type well for the Alke and Lunde formations of the Hegre Group and the Raude and Eiriksson formations of the Statfjord Group. It is reference well for the Nansen Formation.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 33/12-2 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Nordskald on 6 June 1974.  Drilling proceeded to 4354 m in Early Triassic sediments of the Lomvi Formation. At this depth the drill string twisted off leaving a fish with top at 4157 m. Attempts to remove the fish were unsuccessful so 4354 m became TD of the well. No wire line logs were run below 4145 m. The well was drilled with water-based mud. Below 2716 m the mud contained from 2% to 8% oil.


As predicted, the Middle Jurassic Brent Group was thin (17.5 m) and oil bearing (12 m net). Test data and log correlation indicated that the upper reservoir in the 33/12-2 well is a section of the Brent sand and is in communication with the Brent Formation in the 33/12-1 and 33/9-1 wells. The Statfjord Formation top was found at 2700 m, which was 100 m lower than prognosed. The sand was oil bearing through a 126 m gross section with 87 m of net pay sand above an oil/shale contact at 2827 m. The next sand at 2836 m was definitely water bearing from log data. Log analysis indicated an average porosity of 25 percent and an average water saturation of 20 percent. Measured porosities from the cores range from 20 to 30 percent, with an average of 25 percent. Measured permeabilities from the cores range from 200 to as high as 15000 mD; average about 2500 mD. The reservoir sands are fine to coarse grained, occasionally conglomeratic, sub-rounded, poorly sorted, intercalated with carbonaceous laminae and contain kaolinite as matrix material.


Three cores were cut in the well. Core 1 was cut from 2637 m to 2652 m with 84 percent recovery. Cores 2 and 3 were cut in the top of the Statfjord Formation from 2704 m to 2725 m with 63% and 50% recovery. No wire line fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 23 August 1974 as an oil appraisal well on the Statfjord Field.


Testing




Five drill stem tests were conducted in the Brent, Dunlin and Statfjord groups.


DST1 tested the interval 2813.3 to 2817 m in the Raude Formation. It produced 877 Sm3 oil and 82120 Sm3 gas per day through a 44/64” choke. The GOR was 92 Sm3/Sm3, oil gravity was 38.5 °API, and gas gravity was 0.692 (air = 1). Bottom hole temperature during the test was 96.4 °C.


DST2 tested the interval 2780.4 to 2784 m in the Eiriksson Formation. It produced 1939 Sm3 oil and 142720 Sm3 gas per day through a 44/64” choke. The GOR was 74 Sm3/Sm3, oil gravity was 39.5 °API, and gas gravity was 0.720 (air = 1). Bottom hole temperature during the test was 96.7 °C.


DST3 tested the interval 2700.8 to 2703.8 m in the Nansen Formation. It produced 284 Sm3 oil and 37095 Sm3 gas per day through a 16/64” choke. The GOR was 131 Sm3/Sm3, oil gravity was 41.2 °API, and gas gravity was 0.723 (air = 1). Bottom hole temperature during the test was 93.9 °C.


DST4 tested the interval 2526.5 to 2533.5 m in the Dunlin Group. The test produced slugs of oil, gas and mud. Bottom hole temperature during the test was 88.9 °C.


DST5 tested the interval 2485.4 to 2488.4 m in an upper Brent Group sandstone. It produced 230 Sm3 oil and 37660 Sm3 gas per day through a 16/64” choke. The GOR was 163 Sm3/Sm3, oil gravity was 37.2 °API, and gas gravity was 0.720 (air = 1). Bottom hole temperature during the test was 90.6 °C.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 33/12-4
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/12-3 was drilled on the Statfjord structure in the Tampen Spur area. It was designed to test the erosional escarpment on the east flank of the structure for possible trapping of hydrocarbons in an area downfaulted to the Statfjord Field pay section to the west. Primary objectives of the well were the Early Jurassic Statfjord Group sands and possible Middle Jurassic Brent Formation sands. Well 33/12-3 was junked due to technical problems. The rig was moved 30 m and re-spudded as replacement well 33/12-4.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 33/12-4 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Nordskald on 17 May and drilled to 2896 m in Late Triassic sediments in the Statfjord Group. The well was drilled with seawater down to 495 m and with water based lignosulphonate mud from 495 m to TD.


The Middle Jurassic Brent Group was encountered at 2675 m, ca 55 m high to prognosis but, as anticipated, well below the Brent oil/water contact of 2609 m (2584 m MSL) in the upthrown block of the field. Scattered poor to fair hydrocarbon indications were noted in the cores but gas readings were low. Average core porosity in the sands is 23 %, ranging from two to 29 %. Measured horizontal permeabilities average 604 mD and range between 0.01 and 2028 mD. The CPI log indicated some 40 feet of prospective net pay with 23 percent average porosity and 53 percent average water saturation.


The top of the Statfjord Group was penetrated at 2757 m, only 2 m low to prognosis. Core 4 at the top of Statfjord recovered sand, siltstones and claystones with no shows. However, poor shows were recorded above and below the cored section. Using  a 65% water saturation cut-off Schlumberger's preliminary CPI analysis showed hydrocarbon indications over approximately 7 m of net sand within the Statfjord Group, with porosities ranging between 25 to 30 percent and high water saturations of 59 to 65 percent.


Seven cores were cut. Cores 1 to 4 were cut from 2679.2 m to 2721.3 m, core 5 was cut from 2764.8 m to 2772.5 m, and core 6 and 7 were cut from 2775.5 m to 2790.4 m. No wire line fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 17 July as an oil appraisal well on the Statfjord Field.


Testing




Two through-casing drill stem test were run to evaluate the best sections of the thin Brent and Statfjord Formation sands. Both tests produced water at a low rate with insignificant amounts of oil and gas:


DST1 tested the interval 2774 to 2778 m at the top of the Statfjord Formation. The test produced 51 m3 water with 3% oil per day. Oil gravity was 32.4 °API. Bottom hole temperature during the test was 95.6 °C.


DST2 tested the interval 2685 to 2688 m in the upper part of the Brent Group. The test produced 65 m3 oil with 5-10% oil per day. Bottom hole temperature during the test was 85 °C.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 33/12-5
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/12-5 was drilled on the Tampen Spur in the northern North Sea. It was drilled on the southeast, downfaulted flank of the Statfjord structure, but on the upthrown block of the major, east-bounding Statfjord fault. The well was programmed to test in a higher structural position, a Triassic sand, found water bearing in the 33/12-2 well, and to evaluate older, untested section beneath the sand. The Triassic sand in 33/12-2, defined seismically by the "R2" horizon, had been tentatively identified as Early Triassic. Secondary objectives were possible Jurassic reservoirs preserved within this downfaulted area east of the Statfjord Field. The 33/12-4 well was a similar test on the east flank of the Statfjord feature. This well found a thin Jurassic/Upper Triassic? sand with good porosity, which tested saltwater with minor amounts of oil.


The well is type well for the Lomvi and Teist formations.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 33/12-5 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Norskald on 9 October 1975 and drilled to TD at 4574 m in the Triassic Lomvi Formation. The well was drilled water based with a lignosulphonate mud from 485 m to TD.


The Tertiary and Late Cretaceous sections were similar to other wells in the area, consisting predominantly of claystones and siltstones with minor sands. Along the southeast flank of the Statfjord feature, erosion appears to have removed Jurassic sediments and a portion of the Upper Triassic prior to draping of an indeterminate Jurassic sand, interpreted as reworked Statfjord Formation sand, on the eroded Triassic surface. Only minor shows were encountered in the reworked Jurassic sand, which tested saltwater on DST. These were the only shows reported from the well.
                


Top Triassic, Hegre Group, was penetrated at 2735 m. The main Triassic objective, previously interpreted as an Early Triassic Bunter Sand (Lomvi Formation) in 33/12-2 and projected to 33/12-5, was encountered at 3741 m. The sand was 115 m thick and 307.5 higher than in the 12-2 well. Reinterpretation of palynology indicates that this sand is of Late Triassic Carnian-Norian age in both wells. The sand was found water wet and exhibited marginal reservoir characteristics with an average log porosity of only 11 percent.


No cores were cut and no wire line fluid samples were taken in this well.


The well was permanently abandoned on 21 February 1976 as a dry well.


Testing




One drill stem test was performed in the reworked sand on top of the Triassic in the interval 2718 m to 2724.1 m. The test produced 443 m3/day of water without any oil. The bottom hole temperature during the test was 97.8 °C.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 33/12-6
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/12-6 was drilled on Tampen Spur in the North Sea between the Gullfaks Sør Field area and the UK border. The objective was to test a large structural feature in the southeastern part of Block 33/12, located across a major regional fault bounding the eastern flank of the Brent and Statfjord Fields. The targets were sands in the Early and Middle Jurassic sandstones of the Statfjord and Brent Groups.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 33/12-6 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Norskald on 2 March 1976 and drilled to TD at 4612 m in the Triassic Hegre Group.
                


The Middle Jurassic Brent Group was encountered at 2973. Gross thickness was 312 meters. Only rare fluorescence with minor gas readings were noted in the sands. Higher gas readings encountered were associated with coal beds. Using cutoffs of 40 percent clay volume and 12.5 percent porosity, Schlumberger’s coriband analysis indicates 103 meters of net sand with an average porosity of 20 percent. The coriband analysis showed the sands to be water wet with only 6 m of net pay with water saturations less than 65 percent, scattered throughout the unit. The Early Jurassic Statfjord Group sands were topped at 3721 meters. Gross thickness was 309.5 meters. Using the same cutoff parameters as for the Brent formation, log analysis indicated 149 meters of net sand with an average porosity of 16 percent and showed the sands to be water wet. Only 3 m of scattered thin zones had water saturations less than 65 percent. No shows were seen in the samples. However, the core in the Statfjord sands had residual oil saturation over the 6.51 meters recovered indicating earlier oil migration through the section.


The core was cut from 3736 m to 3744 m in the Statfjord Group. Three FIT fluid samples were acquired. One retrieved 10.2 l filtrate and formation water from 3070 m and two were seal failures (3726.5 m and 3727.5 m).


The well was permanently abandoned on 21 June 1976 as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 33/12-7
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/12-7 was designed to drill the Delta structure, a tilted fault block on the Tampen Spur, and was the only commitment well in licence 152. The primary objective was to test the hydrocarbon potential of the Brent group on the Delta structure. A secondary objective was to explore the Statfjord Formation on the same structure. The well was designed as a possible producer in case of a discovery. Shallow gas was predicted at 375 m MSL, 415 m MSL, and possibly in sand lenses on an erosion surface at 456 m MSL.
                


Operations and results


Wildcat well 33/12-7 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Bergen on 22 February 1989 and drilled to TD at 3703 m in Early Jurassic sediments of the Statfjord Formation. After drilling 26" section to 384 m fifteen days rig time were spent trouble shooting and repairing a leak in the BOP. Otherwise operations went without significant problems. The well was drilled with seawater and gel down to 383 m, with Newdrill/PAC/seawater from 383 m to 3034 m, and with gel/lignosulphonate from 3034 m to TD. No shallow gas was encountered in the well.
                


Sands were encountered in the Tarbert, Rannoch, Cook and Statfjord Formations. No shows of hydrocarbons were recorded while drilling, except for some residuals in the Cook Formation. Post-well organic geochemical analyses established that the Draupne Formation has potential for generation of oil and gas and that the Heather Formation has potential for condensate/light oil and gas. Draupne is immature and Heather marginally mature in the well location. Tarbert and Cook Formations were analysed for migrated hydrocarbons but no significant abundance were found.


One core was cut in the interval 3041 m to 3057.5 m. No fluid sampling was attempted.


The well was permanently abandoned on 27 April 1989 as a dry hole.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 33/12-8 A
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/12-8 A is a sidetrack from well 33/12-8 S in the Tampen Spur area. It is situated on a westerly rotated fault block on the southern part of the Beta Ridge. The main objective of well 33/12-8 A was to investigate the hydrocarbon potential in the Middle Jurassic Brent Group in the "Ole" prospect (Skinfaks segment N2), as a result of the positive hydrocarbon discovery in the Skinfaks N3 segment. The secondary objective was to identify the hydrocarbon contact in the Tarbert Formation.


Operations


The wildcat well 33/12-8 A was side-tracked from the 13 3/8" casing at 2066 m in well 33/12-8 S on 26 April 2002 with the semi-submersible installation Borgland Dolphin and drilled to TD at 5098 m /3399.5 m TVD RKB in the Rannoch Formation. The well was drilled with Versavert OBM from kick-off to TD. For well history above sidetrack, see well 33/12-8 S. Technical difficulties were experienced during the sidetrack of 33/12-8 A. Because of problems with attaining the necessary azimuth turn to reach target T1, it was necessary to pull out twice in the beginning of the well to get the desired well path.
                


Both geology and oil-water contact came approximately as prognosed in segment N2. Gas was proven in the uppermost part of the reservoir, while the lower part is oil filled. The sediment layers in segment N2 came in 30 meters deeper than prognosed.


No cores were cut. Twelve fluid samples were collected in well 33/12-8 A, in two reservoirs of the Tarbert Formation. Six of the samples were collected in the N3 reservoir. Oil was found in the samples collected from the depths 2954 and 2922 m. Gas/condensate was found at depths 2906 and 2868 m.  The oil samples collected from depths 2922 and 2954 suffered different technical problems and one sample from 2922 contained 12 percent contamination. The gas/condensate samples contained 28 to 40 percent contamination. The last six samples were collected in the N2 reservoir. Water was found in the sample from depth 4606 m, oil was found in the samples collected from depth 4565 m, and gas/condensate was found in the samples from depths 4136.4 and 4033 m. The oil samples collected from depths 4565 m contained 15 percent contamination. The gas/condensate samples contained 3 to 19 percent contamination. The water sample was not registered with any contamination.


The pore pressure at the top of the Brent prospect in segment N2 is calculated to be 411 Bars (2825 m TVD MSL), corresponding to 1,48 g/cm3 EMW. Well 33/12-8 A was suspended on 16 May 2002 as an oil and gas discovery and a possible future producer.

Well: 33/12-10 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 33/12-10 S was drilled to test the Vollgrav prospect, between the Gullfaks Sør Field and the UK border in the Tampen Spur area of the North Sea. The primary objective of the well was to prove the reservoir potential and hydrocarbons in an untested Late Jurassic depositional wedge of Draupne Formation sandstone, Munin and Magnus members, seen in the Borg Field to the north of the prospect. The secondary objective of the well was to test the reservoir and hydrocarbon potential of the overlaying injectite embedded in sediments of early Eocene age. The TD criterion was to drill to approximately 3075 m, into the Late Jurassic Heather Formation.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 33/12-10 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation  Bredford Dolphin on 30 August 2014 and drilled to TD at 3097 m (3089 m TVD) m in the Late Callovian sediments belonging to the Heather Formation. No significant problem was encountered in the operations. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis sweeps down to 454.5 m and with Aquadril mud from 454.5 m to TD.
                


The Draupne Formation interval was encountered at 2944 m (2936 m TVD), 40 m deep to prognosis. The prognosed Intra Draupne Formation sandstones were not present in the well. Sandstone was found in the secondary Eocene target at 1686.5 m (1686.3 m TVD) but these did not show any signs of hydrocarbons. Fluorescence was described in limestones in a thin Cromer Knoll Group overlying the Viking Group, and throughout the shales of the Viking Group. No real oil show in permeable lithology was recorded in the well.


A total of 32.2 m core was cut in the interval 2938 m to 2970.5 m with 99.1% total recovery. No logs were run on wireline due to dry hole. No fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 23 October 2014 as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/2-1
Wellbore history
 





General


Exploration well 34/2-1 is located a northwestern part of the Tampen Spur area. It was intended to be the first well to test the reflections below the Base Cretaceous (Kimmeridgian) Unconformity on a seismically defined, northerly trending west-northwest dipping fault block. The well was located near the apex of the structure at the Base Cretaceous level, but down-dip with respect to deeper stratigraphy. Primary targets were the Middle Jurassic Brent Formation and the Early Jurassic/Triassic Statfjord Formation. Secondary targets were possible Early Tertiary and Late Jurassic sandstones. Planned TD was 4300 m Sub Sea.
                


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/2-1 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Byford Dolphin on 29 December 1979. Due to problems with the guide line and instability of the temporary guide base three unsuccessful spuds were made before a successful spud was made on 23 January 1980. The well was drilled to TD at 807 meters in the Tertiary. Being unable to latch the BOP onto the 20-inch wellhead, 34/2-1 was permanently abandoned on 23 February 1980 as a junked well. A total of 68 days was spent on the well.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/2-2
Wellbore history
 





General


Exploration well 34/2-2 is located a northwestern part of the Tampen Spur area. It was intended to be the first well to test the reflections below the Base Cretaceous (Kimmeridgian) Unconformity on a seismically defined, northerly trending west-northwest dipping fault block. The well was located near the apex of the structure at the Base Cretaceous level, but down-dip with respect to deeper stratigraphy. Primary targets were the Middle Jurassic Brent Formation and the Early Jurassic/Triassic Statfjord Formation. Secondary targets were possible Early Tertiary and Late Jurassic sandstones. Planned TD was 4300 m Sub Sea.
                


Operations and results


Well 34/2-2 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Sedco 703 on 27 November 1980. Drilling proceeded to 513 m  where bad weather caused a three days wait-on-weather interruption. Resuming drilling the drill string parted and was lost in the hole. Fishing was attempted but the fish could not be retrieved. The well bore was technically suspended on 12 December 1980 as a dry well. Operations were resumed the same day as the re-entry 34/2-2 R.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/2-3
Wellbore history
 





General


Block 34/2 lies at the very northern end of the Tampen Spur and is located at the convergence of pre-Cretaceous Highs trending through Block 34/4 from Brent/Statfjord, from Dunlin/Murchison, from the 34/10 area and from a similar high trend through Block 34/5 from Block 34/8. The block was awarded in License 56 in 1979. The first well in the License (34/2-1) was spudded on 29 December 1979 and junked and abandoned on 19 February 1980 at 850 m, due to technical problems. As the first well did not satisfy License commitments, it was agreed among the partners that Well 34/2-2 would be drilled at the same location with the same objectives. This well was drilled to 4074 m and plugged and abandoned after having found poor reservoir conditions and no hydrocarbon accumulations. Well 34/2-3 was drilled 3.25 km to the northwest of Well 34/2-2 on the northern end of the Tampen Spur. The main objective was to test the sedimentary section below the Base Cretaceous Unconformity in a seismically defined northeasterly trending horst block.


Operations and results


The well was spudded with the semi-submersible installation SEDCO 703 on 15 May 1981. Due to boulder beds at the location the first 36-inch interval was unsuccessful. The well was respudded on 17 May 1981 and drilled to TD at 3742 m in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 815 m, with gypsum/lignosulphonate from 815 m to 3340 m, and with gel/chemtrol/lignosulphonate from 3340 m to TD.
                


While drilling between 820 m and 890 m shallow gas was encountered, giving readings of up to 7% total gas. However, this caused no drilling problems.
                


The well penetrated Tertiary and Cretaceous sediments down to the Barremian Rødby Formation, which was found unconformably overlying Late Triassic Lunde Formation. No significant reservoir zones were encountered above Top Trias. The Lunde Formation consisted of interbedded shales, siltstones, sandstones, and some thin conglomerate beds with the best reservoir properties in the upper section from 3351 m to 3396 m. Apart from the shallow gas there were no significant gas shows until 2335 m to 2440 m where background total gas readings of 1.8% were noted, Cl through to C3 being present. A maximum of 3.4% total gas was recorded at 2370 m. Trace to minor oil shows were recorded sporadically in limestone stringers and sandstones from 2190 m down to 3300 m. From 3300 m to 3370 m oil shows were noted in sandstone, siltstone and limestone throughout the section. At 3360 m, following a drilling break, a small flow into the well was detected. A soft shut in was initiated utilizing the annular bop. Shut in drill pipe and casing pressures indicated a formation pore pressure of 14.6 ppg EMW. The well kick was killed with 15.0 ppg mud. The bottoms-up sample was collected which appeared to contain traces of hydrocarbons. Following the drill break at 3360 m three consecutive cores were cut in the Triassic Hegre Group from 3360.5 m to 3405 m. The core barrel from the first core also contained some oil. Good oil shows were recorded in the most permeable sandstones throughout the cored section and oil bleeding was observed from sandstone and fractures. Wire line logs were run before and after setting the 13 3/8" and 9 5/8" casing and in the 8 1/2" open hole. RFT fluid samples were taken at depths 3354.2 m, 3373 m, 3374.3 m, and 3381.5 m. No hydrocarbons were recovered in any of the samples, only mud filtrate and water.


The well was plugged and abandoned as a dry hole with shows on 13 August 1981.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed

Well: 34/2-4
Wellbore history
 





General


Wildcat well 34/2-4 was drilled in the southeastern corner of block 34/2. The objective of the well was to test possible hydrocarbon accumulations in the middle and Lower Jurassic sandstones.


Operations and results


The well was spudded 22 March 1985 by the semi-submersible rig West Venture, and drilled to TD at 4107 m logger's depth (4110 m MD RKB) in the Lower Jurassic Statfjord Formation. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 814 m and with gypsum/polymer mud from 814 m to TD. No significant problems were encountered during drilling.
                


The lithology of the well corresponded very well with that of well 34/2-2 R with no significant sandstones down to the Lower Jurassic Cook Formation. The primary objective, a distal facies of the Middle Jurassic Brent sandstone, was not seen in this well. Instead, a claystone/shale sequence belonging to the Heather Formation was penetrated. Secondary target sandstones of the Lower Jurassic Cook and Statfjord Formations were drilled proving water wet. Weak oil shows were seen between 3030 m and 3740 m, with the most prominent shows in the 3245-3580 m interval. Oil shows were generally associated with thin sandstones and siltstones in a generally argillaceous section. Occasional thin limestone and/or dolomite stringers also provided oil indications. Geochemical analyses detected possible migrated hydrocarbons also in the Cook Formation. One core was cut with 58% recovery in the interval 3827 m to 3846 m. No wire line fluid samples were taken. The well was permanently abandoned as dry with weak shows on 11 June 1985.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed

Well: 34/2-5 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/2-5 S was drilled to test the Raudåsen prospect on Tampen Spur in the North Sea. The primary objective was to test the hydrocarbon potential in Late Triassic to Early Jurassic sandstones of the Statfjord Group and Lunde Formation.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/2-5 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Transocean Arctic on 28 February 2018 and drilled to TD at 3680 m in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. Operations proceeded without significant problems. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 473.5 m, with bentonite/KCl mud from 473.5 to 906 m, with EMS 4600 oil-based mud from 906 m to 3389 m, and with WARP oil-based mud from 3389 m to TD.
                


Top Statfjord Group was penetrated from 3451 m (3387.8 m TVD) to top Lunde Formation at 3568 m (3504.8 m TVD) The whole of Statfjord and Lunde to TD consist of interbedded sandstone, siltstone and Claystone, with rare beds of Coal and carbonaceous Claystone in the Statfjord Formation. Net/gross reservoir is calculated to 0.61 in Statfjord and 0.44 in Lunde, with 19% average porosity for both. Pore pressure was measured on LWD stethoscope and showed water gradients in both Statfjord and Lunde, but with different pressure regimes in Statfjord and Lunde. There were no oil shows above the OBM in the well.
                


Due to dry well no cores were cut. No wire line logs were run, and no fluid sample was taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 31 March 2018 as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/3-2 S
Wellbore history
 





General


The 34/3-2 S Jordbær Øst well was drilled on the northern fringes of the Tampen Spur and adjacent to BG's recent Jordbær oil discovery. The Jordbær Øst prospect is a down-faulted hanging wall to the Jordbær oil discovery. The primary targets for the Jordbær Øst well was the Lower Jurassic shallow marine Cook Formation and the secondary target was the fluvial dominated Statfjord Formation. The two reservoir targets are separated by Jurassic Claystone and siltstones of the Dunlin Group. The well location and path was planned to avoid shallow gas.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/3-2 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation West Alpha on 25 October 2009 and drilled to TD in the Eriksson Member of the Statfjord Formation at 4331 m (4315.3 m TVD). The well started with a 9 7/8" pilot hole to 1028 m to check for shallow gas. No shallow gas was seen. The main well was drilled vertical down to the end of the 17 1/2" section, deviated to 10 degrees through the 12 1/4" section and back to vertical before the 8 1/2" section, to hit the Cook and Statfjord reservoir targets. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis sweeps down to 1030 m, with Glydril mud from 1030 m to 2403, with Versatec oil based mud from 2403 to 3882 m, and with Versatherm oil based mud from 3882 m to TD.


Sandstones belonging to the Cook Formation were encountered dry at 4011.7 m (3990.0 m TVD). The Cook Formation sandstones had an average porosity of 17.8% net when using a 10% cut off and an average permeability from logs of 9.17 mD. Some parts of the core contain sands with multi-Darcy permeability. The Nansen Member of the upper Statfjord Formation was penetrated at 4273 m (4256 m TVD).The Nansen Member consisted of relatively clean sandstones with minor thin limestone stringers, and it was dry. It had a net thickness of 28.3 m (at 10%) cut-off and an average porosity of 17% net, with an average permeability of 21.4 mD.
                


Gas readings while drilling were slightly elevated in the Cook Formation sandstones but no significant fluorescence was seen in the mud. A 27 m core was cut from 4053 to 4080 m. The core had fluorescence that was marginally above the OBM and post well analysis indicated the presence of oil in saturations of around 5 - 30% from Dean Stark measurements in some zones in the core. However, no moveable hydrocarbons were recovered during the extensive MDT programme. MDT water samples were taken at 4285.91 m, 4050.02 m, 4075.47 m, and at 4025 m (dual packer).


The well was permanently abandoned on 30 December 2009 as a dry well with non-moveable hydrocarbons.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/3-3 A
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/3-3 A is a sidetrack to well 34/3-3 S on the Jordbær Vest west of the Knarr field (formerly called Jordbær) in the northern part of the North Sea.
                
The objective of the 34/3-3A sidetrack was to delineate the 34/3-3 S discovery by confirming the extent of reservoir rocks and also proving oil in the lower part of the Cook formation

                  up-dip and north of well 34/3-3 S
.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/3-3 A was kicked off at 2245 m in the primary well bore 34/3-3 S on 21 November 2011. It was drilled with the semi-submersible installation West Alpha to TD at 5013 m (3962 m TVD) in the Early Jurassic Burton Formation. It was drilled deviated with a sail angle of 57 deg to the Jordbær Vest A compartment of the Jordbær Vest structure. The well was drilled with Versatec oil based mud from kick-off to 4687 m and with Versatherm oil based mud from 4687 m to TD.


Sandstones belonging to the Cook Formation were penetrated at 4809 m (3840.4 m TVD). The Cook Formation consisted of two main sandstone packages. Light oil was encountered in the Upper Cook interval and this proved to be entirely oil-charged while the Lower Cook has a thin oil column and an observed Oil-Water contact (OWC) around 4874 m (3877.7 m TVD). Pressure survey data supported a Free Water Level (FWL) around 4876.2 m (3879 m TVD). Recorded formation pressures also proved that the Upper Cook reservoir has 1 bar (15 psi) lower pressure compared to the Lower Cook reservoir at the time of logging. Reliable oil shows on cuttings above the OBM was recorded only in the oil bearing part of the Cook Formation.


No cores were cut in the 34/3-3 A sidetrack. MDT fluid samples were taken at 4824.97 m in the Upper Cook Formation (oil), 4870.04 in the Lower Cook Formation (Oil), and at 4880.05 m in the Lower Cook Formation (water).


The well was suspended on 3 January 2011 for later conversion to development well (water injector). It is classified as an oil appraisal well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/3-4 A
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/3-4 A was drilled to test the Jordbær Sørøst prospect on Tampen Spur in the Northern North Sea. The primary objective was to test the hydrocarbon potential in the Early Jurassic Cook formation.


Operations and results


On 27 November 2014 wildcat well 34/3-4 A was kicked off from below the 20" shoe set in 34/3-4 S at 1017 m. It was drilled with the semi-submersible installation Transocean Searcher to TD at 4535 m in the Early Jurassic Amundsen Formation. Problems with the cement jobs for the 13/3/8" and 9 7/8" casing cement jobs were experienced, otherwise no significant problem was encountered in the operations. The well was drilled with water based KCl/Glycol mud down to 2258 m and with Versatec oil based mud from 2258 m to TD.
                


Sandstones of the Cook Formation were penetrated at 4370.5 m MD, (4179.8 m TVD). The Cook Formation had 113 m sand with a total N/G of 0.63 based on petrophysical evaluation. The sands were water saturated. The well section that was drilled water based did not have shows. In the oil based section the Cook Formation had good hydrocarbon odour in places but otherwise there were no shows above the oil base.


No cores were cut and no fluid sample was taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 13 February 2015 as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/3-5
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/3-5 was drilled to test the Jordbær Sør prospect about 5 km south of the Knarr Field on Tampen Spur in the North Sea. The objective of the well was to prove petroleum in Early Jurassic reservoir rocks (Cook Formation).
                


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/3-5 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Transocean Searcher on 23 February 2015 and drilled to TD at 4275 m in the Early Jurassic Amundsen Formation. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 1038 m, with KCl/glycol mud from 1038 m to 2203 m, and with Versatec oil based mud from 2203 m to TD.
                


The well encountered an 82-metre thick water bearing sandstone interval in the Cook Formation, of which 47 metres are of good reservoir quality. No oil show above the oil-based mud was recorded in the well.


No cores were cut. No fluid sample was taken. No wireline logs were run in the well. LWD stethoscope pressure points were recorded and proved a water gradient in the Cook Formation, ca 2 bar higher than the water leg in the Knarr Field.


The well was permanently abandoned on 16 April 2015 as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 34/4-1
Wellbore history
 





General


Wildcat well 34/4-1 was drilled on the rotated fault block systems on the Tampen Spur area of the Northern North Sea. The objective of the well was to test the stratigraphic sequence below the Base Cretaceous Unconformity. The primary target was the Intra Triassic "Carnian Sandstone", which was known from two wells in block 33/12 where it constitutes more than 100 m silty, argillaceous, partly calcareous cemented sandstone. The secondary targets were possible reworked Late Jurassic sandstones immediately below the Unconformity, and by possible sands associated with stratigraphically undefined seismic reflectors between Base Cretaceous and Carnian level.


Operations and results


Well 34/4-1 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Byford Dolphin on 11 July 1979. The well was first drilled to 2961 m. When pulling out of hole to change bit it got stuck. The bit could not be worked free and the drill string was eventually backed off and left in the hole. A sidetrack was made from 2484 m and drilled to final TD at 2916 m in the Triassic Teist Formation. The well was drilled with seawater and viscosity slugs down to 844 m, with Drispac/Unical/gypsum mud from 844 m to 1988 m, and with Drispac/Unical mud from 1988 m to TD, including sidetrack.
                


The well penetrated Tertiary, Cretaceous and Triassic rocks with a hiatus ranging from Late Triassic to Early Cretaceous


Secondary target for the well was reworked Late Jurassic sediments immediately below Base Cretaceous. Such deposits were not established. The Triassic sandstones (Lunde Formation) were encountered at 2508 m and contained oil over a column of more than 100 m. No definite OWC was seen, but it could be estimated to be at 2618 m. Numerous shows on sandstone stringers were observed in the Cretaceous from ca 2025 m (top Kyrre Formation) and down to top of the Triassic reservoir. No shows were observed below 2622 m.


Eleven cores were cut in the Lunde Formation. Cores 1 and 2 were cut in the primary well bore, and the first of these was a mis-run. The remaining nine cores were cut in the side track. Two RFT segregated fluid samples were taken. The first, at 2541 m, recovered oil, gas and mud filtrate. The second, at 2639.5 m, recovered formation water and mud filtrate.


The well was permanently abandoned on 16 December 1979 as an oil discovery.


Testing


Two drill stem tests were performed in the Lunde Formation.


DST 1 tested the interval 2608 - 2613 m. It produced a total of 1.65 m3 salt water at a rate of approximately 11 m3 /day (79 bbls/day). The BHT in the test was 94.4 deg C


DST 2 tested the interval 2510 - 2536 m. The average rate in the final flow in this test was 238 m3/day of oil through a 1/4" choke. Average GOR was 120 m3/m3, oil Gravity was 0.82 g/cm3 (41.7 deg API) and the gas gravity was 0.712 (air = 1). The BHT in the test was 90.6 deg C.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 34/4-2
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/4-2 is located in the northern North Sea, approximately 5 km west of the Snorre Field. The purpose of the well was to test the stratigraphic sequence below the Base Cretaceous Unconformity. The primary target was the Statfjord Formation, which was known from the license 037 area to contain porous sandstones of appreciable thicknesses.


The secondary target was possible Brent Group / Late Jurassic sands immediately below the Base Cretaceous unconformity. Thirdly, well 34/4-2 was a stratigraphic test of the Triassic deposits between the Statfjord Formation and the Middle to Late Triassic sequence penetrated in well 34/4-1.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/4-2 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Byford Dolphin on 6 March 1980 and drilled to TD at 3599 m in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. No significant incidents occurred during operations, but the well developed as much as 20 deg deviation towards TD, giving a TVD RKB of 3571 m, 28 m less than measured depth. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 816 m, with gypsum/lignosulphonate mud from 816 m to 1975 m, and with lignosulphonate mud from 1975 m to TD.
                


The well penetrated Tertiary, Cretaceous, Jurassic and Triassic strata as required in the work programme for License 057. More than 900 m of Triassic deposits were penetrated in order to obtain stratigraphic information. The Statfjord Formation was eroded and the reservoir characteristics here were on large negative. The exception was the upper seven meter thick Eiriksson Member with a net/gross-value of 1.00 and an average porosity of 24.3%. The underlying Raude Member had a high clay content, which reduced prospectiveness to a N/G value of 0.18 and porosities only rarely exceeding 20%. The Jurassic sequence proved to be different from the expected with Dunlin Group claystones directly underlying Barremian limestones. Hence, no Brent/Late Jurassic sands were present.
                


No significant indications of hydrocarbons were established during the drilling of the well. Coriband processing of the Jurassic/Triassic sequences indicated a varying amount of residual hydrocarbons to be present from 2990 m, but geochemical study of these intervals showed that these readings most likely were incorrect. Oil shows were reported in limestone and sandstone stringers of the Shetland Group, giving yellow to white fluorescence, moderately fast streaming bluish white cut, occasionally crush cut. In the Jurassic to Triassic sequence, the only reported show was from a few limestone grains, in the interval 3249 - 3256 m, with golden yellow fluorescence and slow streaming, milky white cut.


One core was cut from the Dunlin Group and into the Eiriksson Member. No wire line fluid samples were taken. The bottom hole temperature at TD, from Horner corrected wire line temperatures, was 120 deg C.


The well was permanently abandoned on 24 May 1980 as a dry well.


Testing


No production tests were performed as no significant hydrocarbon shows were encountered.

Well: 34/4-3
Wellbore history
 





General


Exploration well 34/4-3 is located in the Marulk Basin north-northwest of the Snorre Field. It was drilled as the third well on the Gamma Structure and had a wedge structure between the Base Cretaceous Unconformity and the Late Jurassic Unconformity as primary target. Secondary objectives were to penetrate the Brent Equivalent and the Statfjord formation. The well is located on the downthrown side of a NE-SW trending major fault, and the sealing nature of this fault was critical for a closure of the reservoir.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/4-3 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Dyvi Alpha on 16 October 1981 after waiting on location for two weeks due to bad weather. The 26" section was drilled with a 21 1/4" BOP installed but after pulling the riser and the BOP a 26" bit was run in the hole since the underreamer did not perform. Drilling of the 17 1/2" section was delayed by nearly two weeks due to the 18 3/4" BOP not meeting requirements. During drilling of the 12 1/4" section electrical problems on the draw works as well as mud pump breakdowns and high pressures was experienced. Drilling the 8 1/2" section included 4 core runs, killing a water/methane kick at 3555 m, changing leaking seals on riser and two intermediate log runs. TD was reached at 4460 m in Late Triassic sediments. The well was drilled with seawater/bentonite/gel down to 516 m, with gel/gypsum from 512 m to 1019 m, with gypsum/polymer from 1019 m to 2209 m, and with lignosulfonate mud from 2209 m to TD.


A methane gas/water kick occurred at 3550 m when the first Late Jurassic sandstone stringer was entered, giving 21 % total gas. A more continuous Late Jurassic sand was drilled into at 3565 m. Two cores (18 m) were cut in this 27 m thick sandstone sequence. The cores consist of shallow marine laminated shale/silt/sandstone. The sandstone is grey, very fine to fine grained with average porosity 10%, permeability maximum 40 mD and water bearing.
                


A second Late Jurassic sandstone was drilled through between 3704 -3788 m. The sandstone is white, fine to coarse grained, poor sorted and poor porosity, no shows. Minor shows are reported from the Late Jurassic and the basal part of the Cretaceous, occurring from 3524 to 3716 m. Sandstones of core 1 and the limestone in Cromer Knoll Group generally have no stain, but a very weak to weak, whitish yellow to yellowish white fluorescence, yielding no cut to a whitish - milky, very slow streaming cut; and no to slight odour.


The Brent Formation sand was encountered at 3987 m. Two sand sequences, 53 m and 68 m thick separated with 20 m shale, were drilled through. Core No. 3 was cut from the upper part. The sandstone was grey to white, very fine to fine grained, well sorted with calcite and illite cement. Average porosity was 15.6%, with permeability up to 5.8 mD. The Statfjord Formation was penetrated from 4353 m. One core (core No. 4) was cut. The sandstone was light grey to medium grey, very fine to very coarse grained, poor sorted, kaolinitic and with calcite cement. Average porosity was 9.7%, permeability up to 9.6 mD. Thesandstone was water bearing. No fluid samples were taken on wire line. The well was permanently abandoned as a dry well on 30 March 1982.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed

Well: 34/4-4
Wellbore history
 





General
                


The primary objective of the exploration well 34/4 4 was to drill the untested Triassic sequence in the fault blocks west of well 34/4-1. The well location was chosen to be stratigraphically higher relative to the Triassic sequence in well 34/4-1. The purpose of the well location was also to penetrate and core the maximum oil column above the tentative oil water contact interpreted in well 34/4-1 and to test possible lateral fluid communication with 34/4-1.
                


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/4-4 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Dyvi Alpha on 11 September 1982 and drilled to TD at 3800 in Middle Triassic sediments, Teist Formation. As much as 15 % of total rig time was WOW due to bad weather. While coring, after core number 12 was taken, the mud was replaced with seawater by accident and caused a kick, resulting in a 20 bbls influx. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 493 m, with gel mud from 493 m to 1212 m, with gypsum/polymer mud from 1212 m to 2116 m, with Lignosulphonate mud from 2116 m to 2475 m, and with lignosulphonate/Chem-X mud from 2475 m to TD.


First oil shows were recorded on cuttings from thin sandstone stringers below 2075 m, accompanied by increased gas readings. Sidewall cores from siltstone beds between 2100 and 2414 m also occasionally had oil shows.
                


The Early Cretaceous Åsgard Formation rested unconformably on the Late Triassic Lunde Formation at 2425 m. The Lunde Formation sandstones were oil bearing down to the oil water contact at 2586 m. The OWC was set mostly on the intersection of the oil and water pressure gradients from RFT data. The oil bearing sand was separated from the water zone by a 22 m thick residual oil zone between 2586 and 2608 m. This interval had an average net sand porosity of 22%. In the water wet sand interval between 2608 and 2794 m, the average net sand porosity was 21%. No shows were recorded below 2612 m.


A total of 180 m core was cut in 15 cores from 2433.7 to 2638.4 m in the Lunde Formation oil reservoir and down across the OWC. The core-log depth shifts were significant with the cored depth for core 1 being + 9.5 m relative to logger's depth. The shifts for the following cores decreased in a relatively regular fashion with increasing core depth to + 4.5 m for core 15. The RFT tool was run and good pressure data was obtained. RFT segregated fluid samples were taken at 2431.5 m (oil and gas), 2489.0 m (mud filtrate), 2573.0 m (oil and mud filtrate), 2605.5 m (mud filtrate), 2643.5 m (mud filtrate), and 2715.0 (water and mud filtrate).


The well was permanently abandoned on 6 February 1985 as an oil appraisal well.


Testing




Four DST's were performed in the Late Triassic Lund Formation sandstones. The test results were considered to be some of the best so far in the North Sea.


DST 1 tested the water zone from the interval 2618.0 - 2626.0 m. At stable conditions in the final flow the well produced 83.5 m3 water/day through a 32/64" flow. Bottom hole temperature was 95.6 deg C.


DST 2 tested the interval 2572.5 - 2577.5 m. At stable conditions in the main flow the well produced 461 Sm3 oil/day through a 24/64" choke. The separator GOR was 94 Sm3/Sm3. Bottom hole temperature was 96.1 deg C. When opening up to a 52/64" choke the production reached 1606 Sm3 oil/day. No water or sand was produced.


DST 3 tested the interval 2512.8 - 2515.8 m. After perforations the test was suspended for a week due to bad weather. The interval was re-perforated before the test was resumed. The production in this test never stabilized, possibly due to formation damage caused by the interruption period. An average oil rate of 54 Sm3/day was estimated. The oil density was 0.83 g/cm3. No water or sand was produced. Bottom hole temperature was 94.4 deg C.


DST 4 tested the interval 2429.0 - 2437.0 m. During 8 hours main flow through a 44/64" choke the rated declined slowly from 1844 Sm3 to 1717 Sm3 /day. The separator GOR was 70 Sm3/Sm3. The dead oil density was 0.82 - 0.83 g/cm3. No water or sand was produced. Bottom hole temperature was 93.3 deg C.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 34/4-5
Wellbore history
 





General


Wildcat well 34/4-5 was drilled on the Mort Horst in the Northeastern part of the block. The purpose of the well was to test the Zeta structure for hydrocarbons and to test the stratigraphy below the Base Cretaceous Unconformity. The well encountered hydrocarbons in the Cook Formation and in the Statfjord Formation.
                


Operations and results


The well was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Treasure Saga on November 13 1983 and drilled to TD at 3917 m in Early - Middle Triassic sediments of the Lunde Formation. The well was drilled with seawater and bentonite down to 533 m, with bentonite/gypsum mud from 533 m to 1113 m, with gypsum/polymer mud from 1113 m to 2025 m, with gypsum/lignosulfonate (Unical) mud from 2025 m to 3200 m, and with lignosulfonate from 3200 m to TD.


Due to severe boulder problems in the 26" hole section, the well had to be re-spudded three times before the 20" casing could be run and cemented. The 20" casing had to be worked and washed down to the planned depth. This action most likely buckled or partly collapsed the 20" casing. It took approximately 5 days to drill/mill out the bottom section of the 20" casing. Circulation was lost at 2026 m when drilling the 17 1/2" hole. Due to the lost circulation, the 13 3/8" casing had to be set at 2011 m. The 12 1/4" section had to be plugged back from 3106 m to 3005 m due to severe hole deviation problems. The maximum hole angle was 8.75°. Re-drilling this hole section and deepening it down to 3200 m the hole angle varied between 3° and 4°. The 9 5/8" casing was set at 3195 m. The 8 1/2" hole section was drilled down to 3424 m, where the first core was cut. The core recovered shale, and it was decided to drill ahead. The hole was drilled down to 3470 m, where a new drill break occurred. While circulating bottoms up for samples a kick was taken. A total of 43 bbls were gained before closing in the well. Six cores were cut down to 3538 m. Analysis of the formation indicated that the potential reservoir section had not been reached. The hole was this time drilled down to 3561 m, where a new drill break occurred. This time 10 cores were cut down to 3648,6 m. A 7" liner was run in the 8 1/2" hole with the liner shoe set at 3757 m.


The well proved a stratigraphic section ranging in age from possibly Early Triassic to Pleistocene. Minor sand development was penetrated in Miocene and Oligocene. The Cretaceous section was composed of claystones. In the Jurassic two sandstone horizons were encountered, the Cook Formation (3416 m to 3520 m) and the Statfjord Formation (3558.5 m to 3599 m). The Triassic rocks were inter-bedded sandstones, siltstones and claystones. Several unconformities were observed in the well, four in Tertiary, two in Cretaceous, a major unconformity at 3245 m between Callovian and Valanginian, one in Middle Jurassic and a fault cut out in Early Jurassic. Gas peaks up to 7.5 % with shows in limestone stringers were observed in the interval 2137 m to 2600 m in the Late Cretaceous Shetland Group. Weak shows was observed on the core from 3424 m to 3438 m. Good shows with up to 39 % gas was observed in the Cook Formation from 3454 m to 3483 m, from 3483 m shows gradually decreased in intensity. From 3564 good shows appeared in sandstones, and from 3571 m to 3586 m good shows were observed in massive sandstone of the Statfjord Formation. Below 3586 m shows gradually disappeared. No shows were observed below 3603 m.  Testing of the two sandstones proved movable oil present in the Cook Formation and immoveable oil in the Statfjord Formation. Both sandstones were tightly cemented, with poor reservoir qualities. A total of 17 cores were cut as described above. The overall recovery was 95%. Logging operations were hampered by tool sticking, causing considerable discrepancies between drillers and loggers depth. This did not affect the Cook and Statfjord Formation Sands. No fluid samples were taken on wire line. The well was permanently abandoned on 6 April 1983 as a non-commercial oil discovery.


Testing


Two drill stem test were carried out, one in the Statfjord sand and one in the Intra Cook sand. The Statfjord drill stem test, 3589.0 m to 3598.5 m produced water with traces of oil. A rate of 27 Sm3 water/day was obtained through an 8/64 inch choke with a wellhead pressure of 2.51 MPa.


The Cook drill stem test, 3462.7 m to 3480.7 m, produced oil with 19 per cent water. A rate of 48 Sm3 liquid/day was obtained through a 10/64 inch choke and a wellhead pressure of 13.65 MPa. The GOR was measured to 240 Sm3/Sm3 at separator conditions of 1.14 MPa and 40.6 °C. The dead oil density was 0.83 g/cc. At the end of the Cook drill stem test, a hydrate plug was formed in the test string. It was removed by circulating hot mud in the riser and hot tapping of the test string.

Well: 34/4-6
Wellbore history
 








General


Well 34/4-6 was drilled in the northern part of the Snorre Field. The main objectives were to test the northern outline of the field and to confirm the oil/water-contact and reservoir characteristics of the Upper Lunde Formation. The stratigraphy and reservoir characteristics of the Middle and Lower Lunde together with the Lomvi Formations were secondary objectives. Prognosed depth was at 3236 m in Triassic rocks.
                


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/4-6 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Vinni on 31 December 1995 and drilled to TD at 3282 m in the Late Triassic Teist Formation. The 26" section was hampered by bad weather and large parts of the period from the evening of 9 January up to 18 January was spent as WOW. When reaching 740 m the bad weather also made it necessary to disconnect the riser from the well head. Technical problems when attempting to re-latch the pin connector back on to the well head resulted in the remaining section down to TD at 920 m in the 26" section being drilled with no returns to the surface. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 530 m, with gel mud from 530 m to 920 m, with gypsum/polymer mud from 920 m to 2345 m, and with gel mud from 2345 m to TD.
                


Apart from the sandy Utsira Formation of Late - Middle Miocene to Pliocene age (1127.5 - 1239 m) and a sandstone unit within the Hordaland Group of Early Oligocene age (1358.5 - 1387 m), the upper section down to the Base Cretaceous Unconformity proved mainly claystones. No Jurassic rocks were encountered in the well. The Triassic Hegre Group consists of sandstones with minor shales and siltstones down to TD of the well. The target horizon, the Upper Lunde Formation, was encountered at 2576.5 m, 65 m deeper than prognosed. It had a gross thickness of 68.5 m with 39.7 m net sand. Hydrocarbons were encountered in the uppermost part of this formation with an OWC was at 2587 m, determined from RFT pressure points.


The first appearance of shows was seen in the Shetland Group from ca 2090 m. This was seen in silt lenses where pale yellow fluorescence was accompanied by slow to moderate streaming blue white cut reaction. A slight yellow residue was occasionally observed. Entering the main reservoir at 2576.5 m, the shows were as follows in the interval 2576.5 - 2587 m (OWC): 100% yellow brown oil stain, 100% yellow fluorescence with instant to fast streaming blue white cut, leaving a light yellow brown residue upon evaporation. The odour was good. Below the OWC, shows decreased gradually to become extinct below 2624 m.


Six cores were cut totalling 84.5 m. One core was cut in the Shetland Group crossing the border zone into Cromer Knoll Group. The other cores were taken in the Late Lunde Group where hydrocarbons were encountered in the uppermost section. The RFT chambers from this well gave no pressurized fluid samples. An atmospheric RFT sample from 2580 m contained ca 1.6 l oil and ca 2 l water/mud filtrate.


The well was permanently abandoned on 27 March 1986 as an oil appraisal.


Testing


One DST test was performed in the well. This was a combined production/interference test in the Upper Lunde Formation. The well produced from the interval 2577 - 2585 m, with the interval 2592 - 2595 m as an observation interval. The test included three flow periods; 1) Clean-up flow of the lower zone; 2) initial flow of the upper zone; 3) main flow of the upper zone. The two first flows produced only cushion water. The last flow produced 1206 Sm2 oil /day with a wellhead pressure of 153.6 bar. The flowing bottom hole pressure was 359.6 bar at 2546.9 m. The gas-oil ratio was measured to 91.3 Sm3 /Sm3 after a four stage separation. The corresponding dead oil density was 824.5 kg/Sm3. Maximum temperature in the test was 99.7 deg C. During flow 3) wellhead samples and samples for recombination from the separator were taken. These samples include the "DST3" samples in the geochemical download report from IKU found further down on this fact page.

Well: 34/4-7
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/4-7 was drilled in the north-eastern margin of the Snorre Field. The Late Triassic - Early Jurassic reservoirs of the Snorre Field are made up of a complete series of rotated fault blocks dipping between 5 and 12 degrees towards west and northwest. The primary purpose of the well was to assess the upper part of the Lunde Formation. The well was located to provide data on the reservoir quality of both oil and water bearing parts of upper Lunde, and to investigate potential changes in porosity and permeability across the oil/water contact. Further objectives were to verify a revised velocity model for the 34/4 part of the Snorre Field and reduce structural uncertainty.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/4-7 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Treasure Saga on 17 February 1987 and drilled to TD at 2950 m in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. Drilling proceeded without significant problems. The 26" section was drilled first as a 17 1/2" pilot hole down to 915 m as a precaution against shallow gas, then opened up to 26" with an underreamer. The well was drilled with seawater and bentonite down to 470 m, with gel mud from 470 m to 915 m, with gypsum/polymer mud from 915 m to 2407 m, and with KCl mud from 2407 m to TD.


Apart from the Pliocene Utsira Formation at 1062 m and some minor sandy intervals in Middle Oligocene to Late Miocene, the upper section down to Triassic consists mainly of claystones. No Jurassic sediments were encountered in the well. The Triassic Lunde Formation was encountered at 2502 m, 35 m deeper than expected and is composed of sandstones with minor siltstones in the upper part. From 2736 m the Lunde Formation consists of interbedded sandstone, claystone and limestone and from about 2872 m to TD the lithology is mainly sandstones with minor claystone and limestone. Hydrocarbons were encountered in the section belonging to the upper member of the Lunde Formation, from 2502 m down to an OWC, defined from FMT pressure gradients and PLT logging during DST, at 2586 m. The cores from the oil bearing part reservoir shows light brown oil stain with good odour, strong bright yellow fluorescence, instant blue white cut and pale yellow residue upon evaporation. Below 2586 m both shows and cut become poorer, and from 2610 m there were no shows.


Apart from in the reservoir as described above traces of shows were seen first at 2080 m in silty/sandy laminas of the Shetland Group. These are described as yellow fluorescence with slowly to very slowly streaming white yellow cut. From 2270 m the shows are slightly decreasing to a dull yellow fluorescence with very slow streaming light yellow cut, occasionally no cut.
                


Ten cores were cut in the Lunde Formation in the interval 2506 - 2711.5 m with a total recovery of 199.4 m. Segregated FMT samples were taken at 2509 m, 2581.5 m, 2584.4 m, and at 2592.5 m. The sample from 2509 m was sent to the laboratory for PVT analyses. It contained ca 2 l oil and 1.1 l of mud filtrate.
                


The well was permanently abandoned on 12 May 1987 as an oil appraisal


Testing


Two production tests were performed in the upper member of the Lunde Formation.
                


Test No 1 was carried out from the intervals 2579 - 2587 m and 2590 - 2596 m, straddling the oil/water contact. The main flow produced 190 Sm3 oil and 215 m3 water/day through a 7.9 mm choke. The GOR was 105 Sm3/Sm3, the dead oil density was 0.833 g/cm3 and the gas gravity was 0.81 (air = 1). A Production Logging Test (PLT)-flow followed. The PLT flow confirmed the OWC at exactly 2586 m. The temperature recorded by the Production Logging tool was 99.4 deg C, close to the maximum 99.6 deg C measured in the preceding more unstable clean-up flow. After the PLT flow an injection test was performed as the final part of Test No 1.


Test No 2 was carried out from the intervals 2506 - 2512.5 m, 2517 - 2529 m, 2532.5 - 2535.5 m, 2544 - 2550.5, and 2560 - 2566 m in the oil zone. The well produced oil without water continuously for 18 days. During the last 17 days the test produced initially 1550 Sm3/day declining to a fairly constant rate around 1390 Sm3/day through a 14.3 mm choke. The GOR stabilised at 85 Sm3/Sm3 while the temperature stabilized at 96.9 deg C. The dead oil density was 0.835 g/cm3 and the gas gravity was 0.73 (air = 1). The wellhead pressure dropped from 184 to 161 bar through the test.
                


The down-hole test temperatures are significantly higher than the wire line temperatures from similar depths. The bottom hole temperature at final TD in the well are based on the temperature gradient given by the DST temperatures.

Well: 34/4-8
Wellbore history
 





General
                


Well 34/4-8 is located on the "Beta Terrace", a down faulted terrace northwest of the Snorre Block in the central part of the block. The main objective of well 34/4-8 was to test the presence of hydrocarbons and the reservoir quality of the Statfjord Formation on the Beta Terrace. The well should also test the presence of hydrocarbons in the Lunde Formation, improve depth conversion and seismic tie for the pre-Cretaceous levels in this previously undrilled structural element, and give indications on further prospectivity north-westwards in block 34/4.
                


Operations and results
                


Wildcat well 34/4-8 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation "Vildkat Explorer" on 22 May 1994 and drilled to TD at 3110 m in the Triassic Lunde Formation. Since possible shallow gas levels had been predicted, a 9 7/8" pilot hole was first drilled. No shallow gas was found. The well was drilled with spud mud and gel down to 1460 me and with KCl mud with a glycol additive from 1460 m to TD.
                


The Nordland and Hordaland Groups were mainly silty claystones except for the sandy Utsira Formation, which came in at 1123 m. The Nordland and Hordaland Groups had a very high content of drilling gas (average 2-3%), but no signs of gas were seen on the logs. The Rogaland Group was penetrated at 1690 m, and consists of the Balder and Sele Formations. The Balder Formation was dominated by tuff interbedded with claystone. The Sele Formation consisted of silty claystones with traces of limestones. At 1838 m the Shetland Group was penetrated. The Shetland Group consisted predominantly of silty clay stone with some limestones and thin sandstone beds. The Cromer Knoll Group had marl as the main lithology. The marl was interbedded with silty claystones and sandstones. The Dunlin Group consisted of claystone interbedded with marl and minor sandstone beds. The Statfjord Formation was penetrated at 2799 m and consisted of sandstones alternating with shale/claystones. The Hegre Group proved to be generally alternating sandstones and claystones.
                


Weak hydrocarbon shows were seen in the cuttings from 2210 m to 2490 m in the Shetland Group. The shows were seen in the sandstones and in the sandy parts of the claystones. There were bright yellow fluorescence, slow streaming moderate weak cut and yellow white residuum upon evaporation. No shows were seen in the sidewall cores. No hydrocarbons were found neither in the Statfjord nor the Lunde Formations. The only core attempted was in the Statfjord Formation but it jammed off and gave no recovery. No fluid samples were taken.
                


The well was permanently abandoned as a dry well on 21 June 1994.
                


Testing
                


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/4-9 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/4-9 S was drilled on the northern part of the Western Central Fault Block (WCFB) on the Snorre Field in the northern North Sea. This is an appraisal well and the main objectives were to contribute to the technical basis for Snorre North PDO and to reduce the uncertainties in reservoir quality. The reservoir level in this part of Snorre is the Late Triassic Lunde Formation.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/4-9 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Scarabeo 5 on 8 January 1997 and drilled to TD at 3440 m (3388 m TVD) in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. The well was drilled vertical down to 2700 m, from where it built angle up to 24.9 deg at TD with maximum 29.6 deg at 3370 m. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 1235 m, with KCl mud from 1235 m to 1866 m, and with Ancovert oil based mud from 1866 m to TD.


Top of the reservoir ( L01) was encountered at 2512.5 m, 12.5 m deeper than prognosed. The conventional core indicated oil down to 2621.5 m (2596 m TVD MSL) (oil stained sandstones), and the interpretation of pressure gradients (MDT data) indicate an OWC at 2619 m (2594 m TVD MSL). However, the wire line logs indicate high water saturation in the sandstone from 2616.5 - 2622 m (2590.5 - 2597 m TVD MSL) with deepest oil down to 2608 m (2583m TVD MSL). The oil-water contact is therefore set to 2616 m (2590 m TVD MSL).
                


Three cores were cut consecutively over a 209 m long section from 2515 m to 2724 m in the upper part of the Lunde formation with a total recovery of 99.7 %. The core-to-log shifts were -0.61 m for core 1, -1.11 m for core 2, and -0.36 m for core 3. A 2 3/4 gal fluid sample was obtained at 2583 m. Laboratory measurements indicated that the fluid sample was contaminated by 18-22% base oil.


The well was permanently abandoned on 15 February 1997 as an oil appraisal well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/4-10
Wellbore history
 





General
                


The purpose of the well 34/4-10 was to test the hydrocarbon potential of the Delta prospect located NW of the Snorre Field in block 34/4. The Delta prospect is a NE-SW oriented structural trap at the rim of the Marulk Basin. The main objective was to test the lithology and the presence of hydrocarbons in possible sandstone units within the Heather Formation. The well had as secondary target the Brent Group. Planned TD for the well was 50 m into the Statfjord Formation.
                


Operations and results
                


The well was spudded with the semi-submersible rig "Transocean Arctic" 12 February 2000 and reached a total depth of 4246 m in Statfjord Formation 7 April 2000.
                  After 13 3/8" casing at 2380 m the well was temporarily plugged and abandoned due to onshore rig-repair at Ågotnes.
                  After 13 days the well was re-entered as 34/4-10R. The well was drilled water based to 2385 m and oil based from 2385 m to TD.
                  
In the Upper Jurassic sequences no sandstones were found and therefore no core was taken. The Heather Formation was therefore thinner than prognosed. However, a 103 m thick oil bearing, Aalenian to lower Bajocian, Brent sequence was proven. It is an oil down to situation with 10 m net pay. MDT sampling was carried out in the oil column at 3966.5 m. Six sample bottles were filled, 5 SPMC bottles (450 cc) and 1 MRSC 1 gallon sample chamber. About 50 litres of formation fluid was pumped out before sampling was commenced resulting in a draw down during sampling of about 165 bar. PVT analysis indicated a moderately light oil (GOR 135 sm3/sm3, 0.850g/cc - 0.69 g/cc at reservoir conditions) with about 30% sample contamination by mud filtrate.
                  
One 30 m core was taken in the best sandstone interval from 3953.0 - 3980.4 m. The core shows a classical prograding sequence from lower shore face to upper shore face, with a sequence boundary/ ravinement surface near the top. Above this a sandy transgressive interval is interpreted. At the top of the Brent sequence an unconformity is interpreted at 3937 m. Both the formation pressure and the temperature were high. The Statfjord Formation was water bearing. The well was permanently plugged and abandoned as an oil discovery 18 April 2000.

Well: 34/4-11
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/4-11 was drilled north of the Snorre Field and ca two km northwest of the 34/4-10 R Brent oil discovery in the Marulk Basin in the Northern North Sea. The primary objective was to drill and evaluate the Beta central fault terrace to the northwest of 34/4-10 R. The Beta central fault terrace is situated on the same general structure as in 34/4-10 R, but on a different fault block. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the petroleum potential in the Early Jurassic Dunlin Group and Statfjord Formation.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/4-11 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Songa Delta on 13 October 2009 and drilled to TD at 4327 m in Late Triassic sediments of the Lunde Formation. No significant problems were encountered in the operations. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 1340 m, with Aqua-Drill mud containing 3.5 - 4.0 % glycol from 1340 m to 2293 m, and with Carbo-Sea oil based mud from 2293 m to TD.
                


A 51 m thick Brent Group (primary target) was encountered at 3969 m (3938.7m TVD MSL), 18.7 m TVD deep to prognosis. The Brent Group was oil-bearing, but reservoir quality was poor with only 7 m net. The poor reservoir properties resulted in no successful RCI pretests. The Dunlin Group was present as a marginal siltstone facies from 4020 to 4131 m. The Statfjord Formation came in at 4131 m (4100.7 m TVD MSL) with sandstones with oil shows and drill gas peaks with a full C1-C5 chromatograph breakdown. The Statfjord Formation was seen to be an interbedded sequence of sandstone, siltstone and claystone. The Statfjord reservoir was oil bearing down-to at least 4215.7 m (4185.3 m TVD MSL). Petrophysical analyses proved 85 m gross and 22.4 m net oil bearing Statfjord reservoir with moderate quality sandstones with average porosity 19% and average water saturation of 0.38. There was a definite water-up-to at 4301.9 m (4271.5m TVD MSL).The RCI tool recorded two separate oil gradients within the Statfjord Formation oil zone with a reservoir pressure of 11291 psia at 4103.3 m TVD MSL. The underlying logged Statfjord water reservoir had very poor quality sandstones. No shows were recorded above Brent Group level.


Two cores were cut 3976 to 4012 m in the Brent Group with 100% recovery. The wire line logging was very successful with full log data acquired, including 9 x PVT, 6 x single phase and 2 x large volume (10 litre) oil samples from two sampling depths in the Statfjord Formation (4200.3 m and 4162.3 m) and 33 rotary side wall cores. The oil sample at 4162 m was analysed to contain 38.2 deg API oil at reservoir pressure of 11291 psia. However the water bearing basal Statfjord section was of too poor quality sandstones and no water sample was obtained.


The well was permanently abandoned on 10 January 2010 as an oil discovery.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/4-12 A
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/4-12 A (Lower Lunde Snorre) is a sidetrack to well 34/4-12 S, situated on the northern perimeter of the Snorre Field in the Northern North Sea. The surface location of the wells was chosen so as to reach two different prospects with a minimum of drilling and costs. The primary well 34/4-12 S targeted the Omega Nord prospect on a down faulted terrace northeast of the Snorre field while the 34/4-12 A sidetrack targeted the Lower Lunde Snorre prospect up-dip on the Snorre Fault Block itself. The main objective of the sidetrack was to prove oil in the Lower Lunde Member of the Triassic Lunde Formation. In addition the Middle Lunde Member was also expected to be penetrated by the well.


Operations and results


Well 34/4-12 A was kicked off at 1525 m from the primary well 34/4-12 S on 27 January 2010. It was drilled with the semi-submersible installation Ocean Vanguard to TD at 2761 m (2652 m TVD) in Late Triassic sediments of the Lunde Formation. No significant problem was encountered in the operations. The well was drilled with XP-07 oil based mud from kick-off to TD.


The well bore penetrated rocks of Tertiary, Cretaceous and Triassic age. The Jurassic was missing. The Lunde reservoir was encountered at 2563 m (2477 m TVD), which was 27 m TVD shallower than prognosed. Oil was proven in good quality reservoir sands within the Lunde Formation, from 2563 (2477 m TVD) down to an oil-water contact at 2668 m (2570 m TVD). The pressure data proved four slightly different pressure regimes separated by three pressure barriers. Good oil shows were recorded over the reservoir and continued under the OWC with the last show recorded at 2684 m (2580 m TVD). Otherwise no oil shows were reported from the well. The reservoir has a net to gross ratio of 0.31 in Middle Lunde Member and 0.48 in Lower Lunde Member. The total porosity in the Middle Lunde Member is 21% and it is 20% in the Lower Lunde Member. The Hydrocarbon saturation in the Middle Lunde Member is estimated to 63%, while it is 39% in the Lower Lunde Member.


A 54 m core was cut from 2590 to 2644 m within the reservoir, with 99.4% recovery. MDT fluid samples were taken at 2594.7 m (oil), 2642.5 m (oil), and at 2699.7 m (water). The samples were of good quality. Mud contamination in the oil samples was about 2.9 % and 6.4 %, respectively.


The well was permanently abandoned on 19 February 2010 as an oil discovery.


On 28 August 2017 the well was reclassified as an appraisal well for the discovery "34/4-1 SNORRE" from 1979.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/4-13 S
Wellbore history
 





General


The exploration well Beta Statfjord 34/4-13 S was drilled on the Tampen Spur area in the northern North Sea to appraise the Beta Brent Discovery made by well 34/4-11 in 2009. The primary objective was to evaluate oil and or gas in sandstones of the Cook and Statfjord formations and Hegre Group. The original plan was a vertical well, but to meet the time slot available for the rig a site survey over the proposed target location was unable to be completed. Hence a deviated well from the ready surveyed 34/4-11 location was decided.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/4-13 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation West Alpha on 27 August 2010 and drilled to TD at 5010 m (4291 m TVD) in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. The well was drilled directionally (J-shaped well) with a sail angle through the 17 1/2", 12 1/4" and 8 1/2" intervals of approximately 37 deg. Significant downtime with the BOP system was incurred prior to and during running the BOP. Otherwise no significant technical problems were encountered in the operations. The well was drilled with sea water and hi-vis pills down to 1480 m, with Versatec OBM from 1480 m to 4382 m, and with Versatherm OBM from 4382 m to TD.


Top Viking Group was penetrated at 4422 m, the Brent Group came in at 4499 m, and top Dunlin Group at 4525 m. The Brent and Dunlin groups were dominantly mudstones without hydrocarbons except from a silty interval from 4686 to 4710 m that had traces of sand with oil shows. The Statfjord Formation was encountered at 4800 m (4122 m TVD) and had a good quality porous hydrocarbon bearing sandstone interval at the top of the zone from 4801 to 4816.5 m and a smaller porous sandstone interval at 4841.5 m to 4845 m. Core and well log data supported an oil-down-to depth of 4847 m (4160 m TVD). However two additional porous sandstone units identified on logs lower down in the Statfjord Formation at 4871 m to 4872.3 m and 4893 m to 4895.4 m would suggest a potential oil-down-to depth of 4894.3 m (4197 m TVD). There was no oil/water contact identified on the well logs. Oil shows were recorded on core no 4 down to a depth of 4902 m. There were no shows discernible from the OBM below this depth or above 4686 m.


A total of 68.3 m core was recovered in three cores from 4801 to 4849.5 m and a fourth core from 4894 to 4916 m. MDT fluid samples were taken at 4805.1 m (oil with ca 9% mud filtrate) and at 4814.8 m (oil with ca 3% mud filtrate). Single stage separation of the samples, corrected for contamination, gave a GOR of ca 150 Sm3/Sm3, a stock tank gravity of ca 0.823 g/cm3, and a gas gravity of 0.955 (air = 1).


The well was permanently abandoned on 2 January 2011 as an oil appraisal well.


Testing




One drill stem test was conducted from perforations at 4803 - 4815 m (4107 - 4116 m TVD) in the Statfjord Formation sandstone. The main flow produced 1399 Sm3 oil and ca 127000 Sm3 gas /day through a 34/64" choke with no signs of decline of the oil or gas rate. The GOR was ca 93 Sm3/Sm3. All flows were water free, with 3 ppm of H2S and CO2 of about 2% in the gas stream. Bottom hole temperature in the test was 144.8 deg C.

Well: 34/4-14 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/4-14 S was drilled to appraise the 34/4-11 Beta discovery.
                
The discovery was proven in 2010 and is located approximately 20 km northwest of the Snorre field in the North Sea. The reservoir is in the Brent and Statfjord groups. The objective was to evaluate the presence of hydrocarbons at a commercial level, down-dip from the existing discovery and appraisal locations.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/4-14 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Borgland Dolphin on 3 March 2015 and drilled to TD at 4822 m, (4563 m TVD) in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. A 9 7/8" Pilot Hole was initially drilled to a depth of 797 m, being evaluated by LWD gamma ray, resistivity and sonic. No shallow gas, water flows, hydrates or boulders were present. The main well was drilled directionally with kick-off from the vertical at 2103 m and a sail angle below 2748 m of ca 28&#730;. The 8/1/2" section was drilled under High-Pressure-High-Temperature procedures. No significant problem was encountered in the operations. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis sweeps down to 1490 m, and with XP-07 oil-based mud from 1490 m to TD.
                


The well encountered a reservoir in the Statfjord group from the Early Jurassic Age and proved 11 m of net sandstone of good quality. The well is dry. No oil shows above the oil-based mud were recorded in the well.


No cores were cut. MDT water samples were taken at 4642 m. Wireline logging at TD was hampered by poor hole conditions.


The well was permanently abandoned on 19 May 2015 as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/4-15 A
Wellbore history
 





General


The 34/4-15 A Sjøpølse well is a geological side-track to well 34/4-15 S west of the Snorre field on Tampen Spur in the North Sea. The primary wellbore found oil in the Middle Jurassic Rannoch Formation (Dugong prospect) and good hydrocarbon indications in a thin and poor reservoir quality Intra Draupne Formation sandstone. The primary objective of well 34/4-15 A was to appraise the Rannoch Formation discovery in well 34/4-15 S. The secondary objective was to prove petroleum in the Late Jurassic Intra Draupne Formation sandstone (Sjøpølse prospect).




Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/4-15 A was kicked off at 2012 m in the main well on 16 July 2020. The well was drilled with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Yantai to TD at 3844 m (3600 m TVD) m in the Early Jurassic Drake Formation. Operations proceeded without significant problems. The well was drilled with Versatec oil-based mud from kick-off to TD.
                


Top of the Intra Draupne sandstone reservoir was penetrated at 3563 m (3320.6 m TVD). The reservoir is oil-filled with an ODT at 3663 m (3419.3 m TVD). The lower part is a better reservoir than the upper, and fluid sampling proved two separate oils at 0.705 g/cc and 0.65 g/cc in differing pressure regimes.


The Rannoch Formation was encountered at 3704 m. Pressure points gave an oil gradient that indicated 80 m oil column in the Rannoch Formation. However, logs and flowing fluid during sampling concluded on an oil-water contact at 3721 m (3477.3 m TVD), which represent an oil column of 21 m.
                


Three cores were cut in succession from 3569 to 3687 m in the Intra Draupne sandstones. The recoveries were 98.14 %, 98.46% and 102.72 % for cores 1, 2 and 3, respectively. MDT fluid samples were taken at 3565.3 m, (oil), 3626.71 m (oil), 3717.3 m (oil), and 3720.99 m (water with some oil). Gas chromatographic analyses indicated low degree of mud contamination in the oil samples.


The well was permanently abandoned on 12 August 2020 as an oil discovery.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 34/4-16 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/4-16 S was drilled to appraise the 34/4-15 S Dugong discovery in the boarder between the Marulk Basin and Tampen Spur in the North Sea. The primary objective was to prove commercial hydrocarbons in the Middle Jurassic Rannoch Formation, locate the Oil-Water Contact and perform a Drill Stem Test if sufficient oil column.
                


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/4-16 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Yantai on 27 February 2021 and drilled to TD at 3603 m (3583 m TVD) m in the Early-Middle Jurassic Drake Formation. The well was drilled S-shaped with vertical sections above ca 1825 m and below ca 3010 m. Operations proceeded without significant problems. The well was drilled with Glydril mud, seawater and hi-vis sweeps down to 1207 m, with Versatec oil-based mud from 1207 m to 3334 m, and with Rheguard oil-based mud from 3334 m TD.
                


Brent Group sandstones were penetrated at 3457 m (3437 m TVD): The Brent Group includes an 11 m thick Tarbert Fm sandstone on top and Rannoch Formation sandstones below down to top Drake Formation at 3553 m (3532.6 m TVD) Both Tarbert and Rannoch were found oil-bearing. The upper Tarbert oil column gradient lie on a ca 1 bar higher pressured gradient than the Rannoch oil column. Moveable hydrocarbons was seen down to 3489 m (3469 m TVD)


The only shows above OBM was in the oil-bearing Brent Group.


Two cores were cut in succession over the Heather-Tarbert-Rannoch sequence from 3449 to 3503.8 m. Fluid samples were taken at 3476.2 m (oil) and 3497.4 m (water).
                


The well was suspended on 31 March 2021 and then re-entered on 1 September same year for testing. Deepsea Yantai was used both for drilling and testing. The well was permanently abandoned on 23 September 2021 as an oil appraisal well.


Testing




A DST was performed in the interval 3470.2 to 3482.2 m in the Rannoch Formation. The maximum flow rate achieved was during the clean-up flow; ca. 400 Sm3/day, GOR of 185 Sm3/Sm3 on a 32/64" adjustable choke with a FWHP of 74 barg. The production declined during the following flow periods due to near-well bore geometry. The flow data are thus not representative for what will be achieved in a production well. Oil density was 0.827 g/cm3 and the oil produced with 2.2% CO2 and 2.5 ppm H2S. For long term monitoring of the reservoir pressure, two Metrol pressure gauge stations were installed above and across the perforations on a 7" EZSV plug set at 3449.2 m.

Well: 34/5-1 A
Wellbore history
 





General


The 34/5-1 A exploration sidetrack was planned to test an eastern segment of the Blåbær prospect in Tampen North, ca 9 km to the southwest of the 34/3-1 S Jordbær discovery. The primary well bore 34/5-1 S well proved a hydrocarbon bearing column within the Cook Formation in 64 m TVD of interbedded sandstones and siltstones, and the Cook Formation was the target for the sidetrack as well.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/5-1 A was drilled with the semi-submersible installation Bredford Dolphin. It was kicked off on 16 March 2010, at 2137 m from primary well 34/5-1 S and drilled to TD at 4416 m (3731 m TVD) in the Early Jurassic Burton Formation. No significant problems were encountered in the operations. The well was drilled with XP-07 oil based mud from kick-off to TD.


Top Cook Formation (Late Pliensbachian) reservoir came in 27.6 m shallower than the prediction at 4274 m (3602 m TVD). The Cook Formation sandstones had an average porosity of 18.3% and 20 m of net sand based on 50% Vsh cut-and 10% porosity cut-off. As in 34/5-1 S the Upper and Lower Cook had markedly different reservoir properties. Generally the reservoir properties of the 34/5-1 A were worse than the well 34/5-1 S in both units. A very weak residual(?) show was observed in a sandstone sample at 4275 m. Otherwise, no hydrocarbon shows were observed in the well. Mudstone in the lower part of the Drake Formation showed source rock properties with elevated gamma ray above 150 deg API, TOC around 2 %wt, and average Hydrogen Index around 300 with peak HI up to 450 mg HC/g TOC.


Due to dry well no cores were cut and no wire line fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 10 April 2010 as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/5-2 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/5-2 S was drilled to test the Tyttebær prospect on Tampen Spur, 8 km south-west of the Knarr discovery in the northern North Sea. The primary objective was to test the hydrocarbon potential in the Early Jurassic Cook Formation.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/5-2 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Scarabeo 8 on 31 May 2018 and drilled to TD at 3711 m in the Early Jurassic Amundsen Formation. Operations proceeded without significant problems. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis sweeps down to 1070 m, with KCl/GEM/polymer mud from 1070 m to 2133 m, and with Enviromul oil-based mud from 2133 m to TD.
                


The Cook Formation was penetrated from 3588 to 3674 m and consisted of fine to very fine-grained sandstone and siltstone. About 50 metres of Cook was reservoir sandstone with generally poor to moderate reservoir quality. Shows (fluorescence and cut) were observed in the Cook Formation, but post-well geochemical analyses indicated the fluorescence to come from the oil-based mud used in the well. The overlying Drake Formation is indicated by kerogen analysis to have source rock quality. Vitrinite reflectance in Drake is around 0.8%Ro, i.e. oil-window maturity.


No cores were cut. No fluid sample was taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 4 July 2018 as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/7-1
Wellbore history
 





General


The wildcat 34/7-1 was drilled on the E-structure northeast in block 34/7, on a location ca 9 km south-south west of the 34/4-1 Snorre Discovery well in the northern North Sea. The continuation of this structure was explored by well 34/4-4. The main objective of 34/7-1 was Late Triassic sandstones, which proved hydrocarbon bearing in 34/4-1 and 34/4-4.
                


Operations and results


Well 34/7-1 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Vildkat on 9 May 1984 and drilled to TD at 2905 m in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. The 26" hole was drilled and logged first as a 17 1/2" pilot hole to 1106 m as a precaution against shallow gas then opened up to 26" by using underreamer. Tight spots occurred in the 26" hole section. In the 17 1/2" hole the string got stuck at 1274 m. The string had to be backed off and was fished out of the hole. Some tight spots occurred in this section too. When running the 9 5/8" casing, lost returns were experienced three times and the casing was pulled out of the hole. A velocity log was run, and the well was plugged back to 2640 m by setting two cement plugs and the 9 5/8" casing was landed at 2632 m. The well was drilled with seawater and bentonite down to 1106 m and with polymer/KCl mud from 1106 m to TD.


The Tertiary and Cretaceous sections were mainly composed of claystones, with sand development in lower the Pliocene and in the Late Miocene. The Triassic consisted of sandstones alternating with siltstones, claystones and minor marl.


A major unconformity is observed at 2392 m between the Late Triassic and the Lower Cretaceous. Apart from this, four other unconformities are observed in the well, one in Cretaceous, between Albian and Coniacian, one between the Latest Maastrichtian and Late Paleocene, one between Late Eocene and Early Oligocene and one between Late Oligocene and Late Miocene. Hydrocarbons were encountered in the Triassic sandstones (Lunde Formation) from 2392 down to an OWC at 2586 m. The reservoir comprised a number of sandstones with an average porosity of 23.2% and an average water saturation of 36%. The net pay thickness is 93 m.
                


The entire Triassic reservoir section from 2397 to 2623 m was cored in 10 cores with 97% recovery. Three RFT-chambers containing pressurized reservoir oil (2398 m, 2497 m and 2579 m) and one RFT-chamber containing water and mud filtrate (2593 m) were collected in the well.
                


The well was permanently abandoned on 24 July 1984 as an oil appraisal.


Testing


Three drill stem tests were performed in the oil bearing section of the Lunde Formation. All three tests produced oil.


Three drill stem tests were carried out in the oil zone of this reservoir, intervals (DST1), (DST2) and (DST3).
                


DST1 produced from the interval 2574.0 - 2581.5 m. During the main flow period this test produced 897 Sm3/day through an 11 mm choke with a wellhead pressure of 186 bar. The GOR was measured to 84 Sm2/Sm3 at separator conditions of 44 bar and 43 deg C. During this flow the bottom hole temperature reached 96.1 deg C and the reservoir pressure was measured to 388.4 bar. The well produced clean oil with no water or sand after the initial clean up.


DST2 produced from the interval 2455.0 - 2567.0 m. During the main flow period the well produced 509 Sm3/day through a 9.5 mm choke, with a wellhead pressure of 167 bar. The GOR was measured to 80 Sm3 /Sm3 at separator conditions of 46 bar and31 deg C. During this flow the bottom hole temperature reached 92.8 deg C. The well produced clean oil with no water or sand after it had cleaned up.


DST3 produced from the interval 2409.7 - 2416.5 m. During the main flow period the well produced 1606 Sm3/day through a 17.5 mm choke, with a wellhead pressure of 146 bar. The GOR was measured to 60 Sm3/Sm3 at separator conditions of 72 bar and 63 deg C. During this flow the bottom hole temperature reached 91.7 deg C. The well produced clean oil with no water or sand after it had cleaned up.


The bubble point pressures ranged from 174 to 182 bar, representing crude samples from the lower and the upper interval tested respectively (Ref. temp. 92-96 deg C). The dead oil density was 0.83 g/cm3, the gas gravity 0.93 (air = 1), the oil formation volume factor 1.47 Rm3 /Sm3 and the solution gas-oil-ratio in the range of 144-157 Sm3/Sm3.

Well: 34/7-2
Wellbore history
 








General


Well 34/7-2 was drilled just north of the Tordis Øst discovery in the northern North Sea. The main objectives were to test for hydrocarbons in the Jurassic Statfjord Formation and in the Triassic Lunde Formation.
                


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/7-2 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Treasure Saga on 2 September 1984 and drilled to TD at 2475 m in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. A total of 83 hours rig time was NPT due to repairs resulting from a failed RIH with the 26" bit after underreaming to 816 m, and a leak in the acoustic system discovered after setting the 9 5/8" casing at 2031 m. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 848 m, with KCl/polymer mud from 848 m to 2042 m, and with lignosulfonate mud from 2042 m to TD. No shallow gas was encountered.


Except for the sandy Utsira Formation and two sandstone units in the Hordaland Group (in the order of 40 - 50 m each) the well proved mainly claystones down to the Statfjord Formation at 2152 m. At BCU (2085 m) there was a major hiatus from Pliensbachian to Campanian. The Lunde Formation was encountered at 2271 m. The gross thickness of the Statfjord in this well is 119 m with 43.5 m of net sand. The well drilled some 204 m into the Lunde Formation, which in the upper part proved a siltstone sequence with minor sandstone and claystone, while the lowermost 117 m proved a sequence of sandstones alternating with claystones. Of this sequence some 41.3 m could be considered as net. No live hydrocarbons were encountered by the well. Residual oil was found in base Amundsen - top Statfjord Formations, however, cores showed low porosity and essentially no net sand. Extraction data from geochemical analyses also indicate migrated hydrocarbons in the Shetland Group.


Three cores totalling 28.8 m (recovered 22 m, 76% recovery) were cut across the stratigraphic border zone between Amundsen Formation (Dunlin Group) and Upper Statfjord Formation. The FMT tool was run to acquire pressure data and one FMT fluid sample was taken at 2110.5 m. It recovered only mud filtrate.


The well was permanently abandoned on 10 October 1984 as a dry well.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/7-3
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/7-3 was drilled on the Snorre E structure in the northern part of block 34/7. The purpose was to further appraise the reservoir potential of the Statfjord Formation and upper Lunde Formation in the E-structure extension of the Snorre Discovery and to test the oil/water contact found in wells 34/4-4 and 34/7-1.


Operations and results


Well 34/7-3 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Vildcat Explorer on 14 September 1984 and drilled to TD at 3414 m in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. Drilling proceeded without significant problems. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 454 m, with gel mud from 454 m to 1165 m, with KCl/Polymer mud from 1165 m to 2769 m, and with ligno/lignosulphonate mud from 2769 m to TD.


The well consisted mainly of claystones in the Tertiary and Cretaceous sections, with the exception of sand development in the Utsira Formation (Miocene), and an Early Oligocene sand development (1288 - 1323 m). The rest of the well, the Jurassic and Triassic sections, was mainly composed of alternating claystone/sandstone sequences. Top Statfjord was encountered at 2414 m.The Statfjord and Lunde Formations were oil filled down to a common OWC at 2610 m based on pressure gradients. Strong shows on cores continued down to 2622 m, below this depth the shows became weak and spotted. Apart from this oil shows, of variable quality, started in silty claystones at 2180 m in the Late Cretaceous and continued down to 2755 m in the Lunde Formation.


A total of 19 cores were taken in the interval 2396 - 2643 m in the Jurassic (Dunlin- and Statfjord Formations) and the Triassic sequence (Upper Lunde Formation). The core recovery was 91.5%. Core depth for core 17 was 0.5 m deeper than logger's depth and core depth for core 19 was 2.0 m shallower than logger's depth. Otherwise core depths were found equal to logger's depth. In addition to conventional cores 240 sidewall cores were recovered in this well. RFT fluid samples were taken at 2418 m (oil), 2475 m (oil/water/mud), and 2605 (water and mud filtrate with small amount of oil)


The well was permanently abandoned on 2 January 1985 as an oil appraisal well.
                


Testing




Three drill stem tests were carried out.
                


DST 1 tested the interval 2601.0 to 2607.5 m in the upper Lunde Formation. It produced 293 Sm3 oil/day through an 8 mm choke. The separator GOR was 28.5 Sm3/Sm3, the oil density was 0.840 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was . The down hole temperature measured in the test was 94.4 deg C.


DST 2 tested the interval 2505.0 to 2513 m in the Statfjord Formation. It produced 666 Sm3 oil/day through an 11 mm choke. The separator GOR was 26 Sm3/Sm3, the oil density was 0.836 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was . The down hole temperature measured in the test was 91.4 deg C


DST 3 tested the interval 2440.9 to 2449 m in the Statfjord Formation. It produced 1390 Sm3 oil/day through a 12.7 mm choke. The separator GOR was 32 Sm3/Sm3, the oil density was 0.838 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was . The down hole temperature measured in the test was 89.4 deg C.


All tests produced clean oil with no water or sand. The initial oil formation volume factor ranged from 1.23 m3 /Sm3 to 1.35 m3 /Sm3 in DST1 to DST3 test intervals respectively.

Well: 34/7-4
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/7-4 was drilled on the Snorre E structure in the northern part of block 34/7. The primary objectives were to further appraise the reservoir potential of the Statfjord Formation in the E-structure extension of the Snorre Discovery, to test the oil/water contact found in wells 34/7-1, and to test the reservoir quality in this area. A secondary objective was to test the reservoir potential in the upper Lunde Formation, which contain oil in an up-dip location.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/7-4 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Treasure Saga on 19 November 1984 and drilled to TD at 3115 m in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. No significant problems occurred during drilling of the well. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 963 m, with gypsum/polymer mud from 963 m to 2759 m, and with lignosulphonate mud from 2759 m to TD.


Except for the sandy Utsira Formation (Late Miocene/Pliocene) and an Early Eocene sandstone unit (1625-1664 m) in the lower part of the Hordaland Group, the well proved mainly claystones down to the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation at 2535.5 m. The Statfjord Formation was 92 m thick and was oil bearing down to claystones in top Lunde Formation at 2627.5 m. No definite oil-water contact was seen. The N/G ratio in the Statfjord Formation was 0.26. The average porosity was 20 % and the average water saturation was 44%. The Lunde Formation proved mainly a claystone/siltstone sequence in the upper part, while the lowermost 265 m proved a sequence of alternating sandstones and claystones with limestone stringers. Of this sequence some 123 m can be considered as net. The Lunde Formation reservoir was water bearing.
                


Three cores totalling 24.6 m (recovered 22.3 m. 91% recovery) were cut in the Statfjord Formation from 2533 m to 2557.5 m. Core depths were from 2.0 to 4.0 m short of logger's depth. Another two cores were attempted at 2558.5 m and 2559 m, but these gave no recovery. Two FMT-chambers containing reservoir fluid were collected in the Statfjord Formation at 2537 m and 2555 m. These samples proved not to be representative, since the bubble point pressures were too low.


The well was permanently abandoned on 16 January 1985 as an oil appraisal.


Testing




One drill stem test was carried out in the interval 2547.0 - 2563.0 m in the Statfjord Formation. The zone produced clean oil at a rate of 865 Sm3 /day through a 9.5 mm choke with a wellhead pressure of 130 bar. The reservoir pressure was 386.5 bar and the temperature 91deg C at 2555.0 m. The formation permeability was estimated to 1330 mD and no heterogeneities were observed during the test.
                


The separator GOR was 34 Sm3/Sm3 and the dead oil density was 0.843 g/cc with a Formation Volume Factor of 1.27.

Well: 34/7-5
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/7-5 is located in the Statfjord Øst area of the Northern North Sea. The primary objectives of the well were to test the reservoir potential of the Brent Group, and to determine if the oil/water contact is the same as that found in the 33/9-7 Statfjord Øst discovery well drilled to the south southwest of this well in the neighbouring block, but on the assumed same structure. A secondary objective was to test the reservoir potential of the Statfjord Formation.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/7-5 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Treasure Saga on 17 January 1985 and drilled to TD at 3146 m in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. Drilling proceeded without significant problems. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 930 m and with gypsum/polymer mud from 930 m to TD.


Trace oil shows appeared in sandstone lamina in the Cretaceous from about 2380, limestones had shows from about 2488 m. The Brent Group reservoir came in at 2502 m, approximately 60 m deeper than prognosed. Hydrocarbons were encountered in the upper section belonging to the Ness Formation. The oil/water contact could not be defined from pressure data. From shows on cores and the well logs an OWC could be placed at approximately 2521 m, in accordance with the results from well 33/9-7. Below the OWC oil shows on sandstone decreased gradually from 2523 m until they vanished at 2616 m. The Statfjord Formation was dry.
                


Eleven cores were cut. Cores 1 to 10 were cut from 2508 m to 2633 m in the Brent Group and the uppermost part of the Drake Formation. Core 1, from 2508 to 2510 gave no recovery. The core depths for Cores 2 to 10 were from 0.5 m to 2.2 m short of logger's depth. Core 11 was cut from 2869 m to 2883.5 m in the calcareous Amundsen Formation. For this core there was no difference between core depth and logger's depth. No wire line fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 16 March 1985 as an oil appraisal.


Testing




Two drill stem tests were performed from the interval 2502.5 - 2512.5 m.


The first test, DST 1, produced oil with a water cut of 50%, strongly suggesting water channelling behind casing from the underlying water zone.
                


Cement was squeezed behind casing to isolate the perforated zone and a second repeat test, DST 1A was initiated. This test produced clean oil at a rate of 260 Sm3 /day through a 9.5 mm choke. The wellhead pressure was 72 bar. The highest recorded bottom hole temperature was 88 deg C in both DST 1 and in DST 1A.

Well: 34/7-6
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/7-6 was drilled centrally on the Snorre Field in the Tampen Spur area of the North Sea. The objectives were to test the reservoir quality of the Statfjord Formation and the extent of the low GOR oil encountered in the 34/7-3 and 34/7-4 wells. Further objectives were to test the proposed subdivision and reservoir characteristics of the Triassic Lunde and Lomvi formations.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/7-6 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Treasure Saga on 17 March and drilled to TD at 3685 m in the Triassic Teist Formation. No significant problem was encountered in the drilling phase. After DST 1 parts of the test string stuck, leaving a fish with top at 2533 m in the hole. The fish was pushed down 12 m to give space for further testing. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 965 m, with gypsum/polymer mud from 965 m to 3015 m, and with Drispac/Ligcon mud from 3015 m to TD.


Apart from the sandy Utsira Formation of Late Oligocene - Pliocene age, and sandstone units of Early Oligocene age (1215 - 1280 m) and Middle - Late Eocene age (1370 - 1420 m) within the Hordaland Group, the upper section down to the Jurassic proved mainly claystones. The Jurassic consists of a silty Dunlin Group and a sandy Statfjord Group. The Triassic had sandstones alternating and interbedded with claystones down to TD.
                


Silty laminae in the Shetland Group had traces of shows from about 2110 m. These were described as gold yellow fluorescence with no cut. From 2155 m and down to 2500 m silt and sandstone show golden yellow fluorescence and slow streaming cloudy yellow fluorescence cut. Occasionally light brown staining and weak odour are observed from 2500 m. Hydrocarbons were encountered from top Statfjord Group at 2510 m down to an oil-water contact at 2610 m in the uppermost part of the Upper Lunde Formation. The contact lie in a shaley interval and is set from pressure gradient measurements. There were no shows below the OWC.


A total of 151 m core was recovered in 13 cores. Ten cores were cut (recovered 93.6 m, 86.7%) in the Statfjord Group and across the stratigraphic border zone into the Upper Lunde Formation of the Hegre Group. Cores 11 and 12 were cut further down in Upper Lunde Formation (recovered 38.5 m, 96.3%). Core 13 was cut in the Lomvi Formation (recovered 18.5 m, 100%).The core - log depth shifts for the individual cores varied from -1.3 m to -5.0 m. FMT segregated fluid samples were taken at 2561.4 m, 2584.4 m, and 2595.4 m.


The well was permanently abandoned on 30 May 1985 as an oil appraisal well.


Testing




Four DST's were carried out in the Statfjord Group and Lunde Formation.


DST 1 tested the Upper Lunde at 2679 - 2687 m. The test produced water at a final rate of 225 m3 /day. The bottom hole temperature was 93.7 °C.


DST 2 tested the Eiriksson Formation from perforations at 2549.5 - 2552.0 m, 2555.0 - 2563.0 m, and 2568.0 - 2572.5 m. The flow rate was 519 Sm3 oil/day through a 7.9 mm choke. The GOR was 66 Sm3/Sm3 at separator conditions (11.7 bar, 29.4 °C). The oil density was 0.834 g/cm3. The bottom hole temperature was 90.9 °C.


DST 3A tested the Nansen Formation at 2518.5 - 2522.5 m. The flow rate was 393 Sm3 oil/day through a 6.4 mm choke. The GOR was 52 Sm3/Sm3 at separator conditions (15 bar, 16.7 °C). The oil density was 0.837 g/cm3. The bottom hole temperature was 90.2 °C.


DST 3B tested both Eiriksson and Nansen formations from perforations at 2518.5 - 2522.5 m and 2526.5 - 2536.5 m. The flow rate was 1729 Sm3 oil/day through a 14.3 mm choke. The GOR was 49 Sm3/Sm3 at separator conditions (36.2 bar, 52.8 °C); at stock tank conditions, the GOR was 85 Sm3/Sm3. The oil density was 0.8389 g/cm3. The bottom hole temperature was 89.9 °C.

Well: 34/7-7
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/7-7 was drilled on the western side of the “Inner Main Fault” near the geographic centre of the Snorre Field. The objectives were to test the reservoir quality of the Statfjord Group and the Oil-Water Contact, expected to be at 2611 m. Further objectives were to test the subdivision and reservoir characteristics of the Triassic Lunde Formation.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/7-7 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Treasure Saga on 17 September 1985 and drilled to TD at 3526 m in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. A 17 1/2” pilot hole was drilled from 455 m to 995 m to check for shallow gas before opening up to 26”. No shallow gas was seen. Some fishing jobs were required during logging and testing, otherwise operations proceeded without significant problems. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 455 m, with gel mud from 455 m to 995 m, with gypsum/polymer mud from 995 m to 2562 m, and with gel mud from 2562 m to TD.


Well 34/7-7 penetrated top reservoir at 2561.1 m. The OWC was defined at 2615 m in the Statfjord Group. The average log porosity in the oil zone is 26.2%, the net/gross is 0.37, and the average water saturation is 26.2%. Weak oil shows were seen from around 2140 m in sandstone and siltstone from early Campanian in the Shetland Group (top Kyrre Formation) and down to to the top Dunlin Group at 2455 m. Through the Dunlin Group down to the top Statfjord reservoir at 2561 m, the shows became stronger. Below the OWC, a sandstone interval at the bottom of the Statfjord (2640 - 2644 m) had good oil shows. Going into the Upper Lunde, the shows disappear.


Nineteen cores were cut and recovered during drilling of the well. Core 1 to 8 were cut from 2563 to 2669.5 m through the whole Statfjord Group and the first meters of the Upper Lunde Formation. Core 9 to 19 were cut in the interval 2888.2 to 3336.7 m in the Upper Lunde Formation. Total core recovery was 197.25 m (94.1%). The core - log depth shifts for the individual cores varied from -0.6 m to +1.8 m. FMT oil samples were taken at 2613.5 m and 2564.8 m.


The well was permanently abandoned on 16 December as an oil appraisal well.


Testing




Two Drill Stem Tests (DST) were carried out in the Statfjord Group, Eiriksson Formation.


DST 1 tested the interval 2561.5-2569.5 m at the top of the oil zone. The test produced 1720 Sm3 oil /day through a 14.3 mm choke. At stock tank conditions the GOR was 68 Sm3/Sm3, the oil density was 0.8362 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was 1.059 (air = 1). The bottom hole temperature was 93 °C.


DST 2 tested the interval 2611.7-2614.7 m just above the OWC. The test produced 980 Sm3 oil /day through a 71.8 mm choke. At stock tank conditions the GOR was 62.5 Sm3/Sm3, the oil density was 0.8403 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was 1.081 (air = 1). The bottom hole temperature was 93 °C.

Well: 34/7-8
Wellbore history
 





General


Wildcat well 34/7-8 was drilled on the "C" structure south of the Snorre field area on Tampen Spur in the Northern North Sea. The Late Triassic - Early Jurassic reservoirs of the structure are tilted fault blocks dipping in a generally north westerly direction. The "C" structure is defined by a major west bounding fault with throws up to 350 m in the northwest, diminishing to 20 m at the southern end. The main objectives of the well were to test the quality and thickness of the Statfjord Formation and the Upper Lunde Formation. Further objectives were to test the fluid content of the structure and sealing effect of the "C" horst fault.


Operations and results


Well 34/7-8 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Treasure Saga on 5 February 1986 and drilled to TD at 2766 m in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. Problems with tight hole were experienced through several zones in the 17 1/2" section. At 1642 m the pipe stuck and had to be worked free. During plug and abandon operation of the combined cut and pull tool caused problems. After several attempts of cutting, the string parted in the section of drill collars. Fifty-seven m of drill collar, cut and pull tool, wellhead with casing strings, TGB and PGB were left on the seabed. Seabed clean-up operations were carried out in June 1986, after abandonment. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 439 m, with gel mud from 439 m to 870 m, with gypsum/polymer mud from 870 m to 2280 m, and with gel mud from 2280 m to TD.


Apart from the sandy Utsira Formation of Late Oligocene - Pliocene age, an Early Oligocene (1265 - 1350 m) and a Middle - Late Eocene (1445 - 1465 m) sandstone unit within the Hordaland Group, the Tertiary and Cretaceous proved mainly claystones. The Jurassic consists of reworked sandstone, a claystone rich Dunlin Group and alternating sandstones and claystones in the Statfjord Formation. The Triassic proved sandstones occasionally alternating and interbedded with claystones down to TD


Oil was encountered from 2275 m in the Late Jurassic "Reworked Sand" (Formally named Intra Draupne Formation Sandstone). No oil water contact was defined. From log evaluation oil was estimated down to 2405 m (Statfjord Formation) and water up to 2525 m (Lunde Formation). The Intra Draupne sand (2275.0 - 2284.5 m) had an average log porosity of 25.1%, average water saturation of 15% and N/G of 0.94. In the Statfjord Formation (2299 - 2373 m) the average porosity was 21.7%, the water saturation was 35% and the N/G was 0.33. In the Upper Lunde Formation down to 2405 m, the average porosity was 20.3%, the water saturation 67%, and the N/G 0.18.


Trace shows were first encountered in sandy lamina from top of the Rogaland Group at 1690 m. First occurrence of C2+ in mud gas was detected at 2055 m. The shows were poor to moderate down to top reservoir. Strong oil shows, stain and odour was recorded on sandstones in the reservoir with the deepest show recorded on cored sandstone at 2401 to 2403 m in the lower part of the Statfjord Formation.


Four cores were cut in this well. The first was cut from 2280 - 2294.4 m in the Reworked Jurassic Sandstone and into the Dunlin Group. Cores No. 2 and 3 were cut in the Statfjord Formation in the intervals 2325 - 2365 m and 2401 - 2406.4 m. The lowest core was cut at 2397 - 2407 m in the Upper Lunde Formation. Two FMT fluid samples were recovered from 2398.2 m (0.2 l oil and 2.2 l filtrate) and at 2302 m (1.2 l oil and 2.8 l filtrate).


The well was permanently abandoned on 11 April 1986 as an oil discovery.


Testing


A total of 3 production tests were carried out in the Upper Lunde, the Statfjord Formation and the Intra Draupne Formation sand.


Test 1A produced from the Statfjord Formation (2359 - 2374 m). The oil production rate through a 6.4 mm choke was 46 Sm3 /day at 18 bar wellhead pressure. The GOR was 55 Sm3/Sm3 and the stock tank oil density was 0.855 g/cm3. The reservoir temperature was measured to 86.5 deg C.


During test 1B, both the Statfjord Formation (2359 - 2374 m) and the Upper Lunde Unit A (2397 - 2405 m) perforation intervals were open to flow. The oil production rate was 120 Sm3/day through a 19.1 mm choke at 6.5 bar wellhead pressure. It could not be established if the deeper Lunde Formation interval contributed to the flow. The GOR was 46 Sm3/Sm3 and the stock tank oil density was 0.8513 g/cm3. The reservoir temperature was measured to 87.1 deg C.


Test 2 produced from the Statfjord Formation (2329 - 2334 m). The production rate was 270 Sm3/day through a 6.4 mm choke with a wellhead pressure of 99 bar. The GOR was 84 Sm3/Sm3 and the stock tank oil density was 0.8425 g/cm3. The reservoir temperature was measured to 86.2 deg C.


Test 3 produced from the Intra Draupne Formation sand (2276 - 2284 m). The production rate was 1300 Sm3/day through a 17.5 mm choke. The GOR was 69 Sm3/Sm3 and the stock tank oil density was 0.853 g/cm3. The reservoir temperature was measured to 85.3 deg C.

Well: 34/7-9
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/7 9 was drilled on the Snorre structure in the northernmost part of the block. The main objective of the well was to test the hydrocarbon potential of the upper Lunde Formation in the Snorre structure.
                


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/7-9 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Treasure Saga on 13 April 1986 and drilled to TD at 3240 m in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. Minor shallow gas peaks were observed from mud gas readings in the pilot hole below the 30" casing at 498 - 500 m. Drilling proceeded without significant problems. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 471 m, with gel mud from 471 m to 915 m, with gypsum/polymer mud from 915 m to 2479 m, and with gel mud from 2479 m to TD.


Well 34/7-9 penetrated the reservoir at 2442.5 m, 50 m deeper than prognosed. From FMT pressure points the the oil water contact (OWC) was defined in the upper Lunde at 2600 m (2574 m MSL). The average log porosity in the oil zone was 25.6%, the net/gross was 0.24, and the average water saturation was 30%.
                


Shows were seen from 2100 to 2315 m in the Shetland Group. Below 2315 m the shows disappeared and did not reappear before the upper Lunde reservoir was penetrated at 2442.5 m. Down to a sandstone/claystone boundary at 2594 m, the sandstones showed a pale brown oil stain, fair to good odour, 100% - 90% strong, patchy, yellow to light yellow fluorescence, fast to instant streaming bluish white cut and a pale yellow residue upon evaporation. Below 2594 m no shows were seen.


A total of 10 cores were cut and recovered during drilling of the well. The cores were taken in the upper Lunde Formation from 2470.0 to 2720.5 m core depth. The average core recovery was 96.7%. Logger's depths for the cores were from 1.75 to 4.00 m shallower than the core depths. FMT fluid samples were taken at 2585 m and 2592 m. All analysed sample chambers contained black oil and brown-grey water with sediments.


The well was permanently abandoned on 12 June 1986 as an oil appraisal.


Testing




One DST was carried out with four zones in the upper Lunde Formation flowing simultaneously: 2501 - 2504 m, 2506 - 2515 m, 2527 - 2536 m, and 2550 - 2553. The zones were flowed for 175 hours, followed by a build-up of 50 hours. During the main flow period the flow rate through a 15.9 mm choke decreased from 1400 Sm3 /day to 896 Sm3 /day and the corresponding wellhead pressure decreased from 130 to 93 bar. Fluid analyses of pressurized samples from the test gave a GOR of 103 Sm3/Sm3 and stock tank oil density of 0.8258 g/cm3. The maximum temperature recorded at reference depth, mid-perforations, was 93.3 deg C.

Well 34/7-12 is a replacement well for well 34/7-11, which was junked for technical reasons. It is located in the Tampen Spur area in the Northern North Sea. Its overall purpose was to assess the hydrocarbon potential in the "B"-structure in the southern part of the block. The primary objectives were to establish the thickness and reservoir quality of the prospective Brent the Brent Group in Group, and to determine the OWC. The secondary objectives were to assess the potential of the Dunlin Cook Formation reservoir, the Statfjord Formation and the upper part of the Triassic Lunde unit B/C reservoir section. TD was prognosed to 2900 m.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/7-12 was spudded 20 m north of the 34/7-11 location. It was drilled with the semi-submersible installation Treasure Saga on 11 October 1987 and drilled to TD at 2784 m in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. The well was drilled without significant technical problems. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 852 m and with KCl mud from 852 m to TD.


The Brent Group came in at 2169 m, and Statfjord Formation at 2606 m. Lunde Formation was encountered at 2763 m. Oil/water contact was defined in the Ness Formation at 2250 m.


The Brent Group, from 2169 to 2340.5 m (171.5 m thick) comprised the sandy Tarbert Formation,the interbedded shaly and sandy Ness Formation, the sandy Etive and Rannoch Formations and at the base the conglomeratic Broom Formation. The Dunlin Group was penetrated from 2340.5 to 2606 m (265.5 m thick), comprising the shaly Drake Formation at the top, the Cook Formation with interbedded sandstone and claystone, the Burton Formation with claystone and minor sandstone and the Amundsen and Calcareous Amundsen Formations having clay stones with minor limestone. The Statfjord Formation, 157 m thick from 2606 to 2763 m, was dominated by sandstones with minor to interbedded claystone. The Late Triassic upper Lunde Formation was encountered at 2763 m, and comprised clay stone interbedded with siltstone.
                


The Brent Group was hydrocarbon-bearing through the Tarbert Formation and into the Ness Formation with an OWC at 2250 m, confirmed by logs and FMT pressure gradients. Shows were seen down to 2268 m. In addition, shows were reported from a sidewall core cut at 1803 m in a Paleocene sand. Logs also indicated the presence of a two metre thick residual or hydrocarbon bearing zone from 1801 m to 1803 m. Shows were also reported in siltstones in the interval 2060 to 2142 m in the Late Cretaceous Kyrre Formation. No indications of hydrocarbons were reported below 2268 m.


A total of 10 cores were cut from 2169 to 2360.5 m in the Brent Group and 20 m into the Dunlin Group. A total of 180.8 m core was recovered (94.4 % of cored section). FMT segregated fluid samples were taken at 2171 m (oil and gas), 2171.5 m (oil and gas), 2189.5 m (two samples in different runs, both with oil and gas), 2249.5 m (gas and oil-cut mud), and at 2252.5 m (water). The samples from 2171 and 2189.5 m were analysed and found to be very similar with oil densities close to 0.845 g/cm3, gas gravities in the range 0.863 to 0.879, and CO2 contents in the range 0.22 to 0.29 %.


The well was permanently abandoned on 17 December 1987 as an oil discovery.


Testing


Three drill stem tests were performed in well 34/7-12.
                


DST 1 tested the interval 2276.2 - 2282.2 m in the Rannoch Formation and produced up to1297 Sm3 water/day through a 12.7 mm choke. Up to 10% sand production was reported in the beginning of the main flow period. Maximum down-hole temperature recorded (at 2230.7 m) was 84.2 deg C.


DST 2 tested the interval 2229 - 2235 m in the Ness Formation. On a 12.7 mm choke this test produced 881 Sm3 oil and 59383 Sm3 gas /day. The corresponding GOR was 68 Sm3/Sm3, the oil density was 0.841 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was 0.722 (air = 1). Maximum down-hole temperature recorded (at 2202.6 m) was 83.4 deg C.


DST 3 tested the interval 2205.5 - 2209.5 m in the lower Tarbert Formation. On a 14.3 mm choke this test produced 1460 Sm3 oil and 96450 Sm3 gas /day. The corresponding GOR was 68 Sm3/Sm3, the oil density was 0.840 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was 0.695 (air = 1). Maximum down-hole temperature recorded (at 2161.3 m) was 82.1 deg C.

Well: 34/7-13
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/7-13 was drilled in the north western part of block 34/7 on the Snorre West prospect. The prospect is divided into two main fault segments by a SW NE trending fault with a throw of 60 m. The well was located in the southern part of the two segments. The primary purposes of the well were to explore the Snorre West prospect and to test a possible extension of the Statfjord East Field in a northward direction. The main target of the well was sandstones of the Middle Jurassic Brent Group. Secondary target was sandstones of the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/7-13 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Treasure Saga on 19 February 1988 and drilled to TD at 2994 m in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. Drilling proceeded without significant problems, but up to 21 deg deviation in the deepest section of the well caused 11 m deviation between MD and TVD at TD. Shallow gas was encountered at 459 m, but it did not cause any technical problems. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 434, with Gel mud from 434 m to 973 m, with KCl mud from 973 m to 2682 m, and with gel mud from 2682 m to TD.
                


Above the Jurassic the well penetrated mainly claystones with the exception of the Utsira Formation and some sandstone intervals between 1265 and 1325 m in the Hordaland Group. The Jurassic comprised the Middle Jurassic Brent Group, and the Early Jurassic Dunlin Group and Statfjord Formation. The Triassic comprised the Late Triassic upper Lunde Formation. The sandstones of the Brent Group, the Etive Formation, were encountered at 2492.5 m (TVD: 2490 m). The Etive Formation proved oil bearing, and the OWC was calculated to be at 2505.5 m (TVD: 2503 m). This was a thinner oil column than prognosed and the resources for the prospect were thus reduced compared to what was expected.
                


The sandstones of the Statfjord Formation proved water bearing.


First sign of petroleum hydrocarbons (C2 - C3) were reported at 2260 m. From 2285 m weak oil shows were seen in sand stringers. Over the reservoir and down to approximately 2510 m good oil shows were observed. Below 2510 m oil shows got weaker but traces were seen down to 2590 m.


Five cores were cut in the interval 2496 - 2587.8 m. A total of 5 cores were cut throughout this section with 99 % recovery. A sixth core was cut from 2873 to 2890.5 m in the Statfjord Formation. FMT samples were taken at 2493.4 m (oil), 2494.4 m (oil), and 2503.7 m (water contaminated with mud filtrate). Single stage flash of the sample from 2493.4 m gave a GOR of 84.3 Sm3/Sm3, an oil density of 0.8392 g/cm3, and a gas gravity of 0.925 (air = 1).


The well was permanently abandoned on 13 April 1988. It is classified as an oil appraisal on the Vigdis Discovery.


Testing


One DST was performed in the interval 2498.1 - 2501.1 m in the Etive Formation. At the end of a 6.8 hours flow period, "Formation characteristics flow", the well produced 935 Sm3/day of oil with a GOR of 49 Sm3/Sm3 through an 11.1 mm choke. In the beginning of the main flow period the maximum recorded oil rate was 1350 Sm3/day through a 16 mm choke. The GOR in this flow was 51 Sm3/Sm3 and the oil density was 0.840 g/cm3. At the end of the main flow the well produced with 30-35% water cut. Sand production was also observed. Maximum down-hole temperature in the test (measured during main flow) was 90 deg C.
                


A second DST was omitted due to problems caused by sand production.

Well: 34/7-14
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/7-14 was drilled in on the "B-structure", today named the Tordis Field, in the southern part of block 34/7. The Middle Jurassic Brent Group reservoir is located in tilted fault blocks dipping in a westerly direction within the southern fault segment about 1.4 km south of the well 34/7-12. The structure has a NE-SW trend and is bounded to the east and north by major faults, i.e. Northern Main Fault and Southern Main Fault with throws of 50-200 m. The primary purpose of well 34/7-14 was to further delineate and appraise the Tordis Field. The main target of the well was the sandstones in the Brent Group. Secondary objective was the sandstones of the Early Jurassic Cook Formation.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/7-14 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation "Vildkat Explorer" on 28 September 1989 and drilled to a total depth of 2653 m in the Early Jurassic Burton Formation. Shallow seismic indicated gas at 246 & 285 m, 344 m, 376 m, and 511 m. Measurement and logging while-drilling (MWD) verified the indication at 511 m as a thin, gas-filled sand. The upper part of the well was drilled as a 9 1/2" pilot hole without a riser and was plugged back from 511 m due to lack of reliable gas readings in the sand layer. Lost circulation occurred at 2137 m, and the well was plugged back to the 13 3/8" casing shoe. The well was drilled with gel mud (barite, bentonite, caustic soda, soda ash) down to 495 m and with KCl mud from 495 m to TD.
                


Down to 2189 m, the top of the Brent reservoir, the well proved mainly claystones. Exceptions to this were the sandy Utsira Formation of Miocene/Pliocene age encountered at 856 m, and sandstones within the Hordaland Group encountered in the interval 1167 - 1456 m. The Jurassic comprised the Middle Jurassic Viking and Brent Groups and the Early Jurassic Dunlin Group.& Top Brent Group was encountered at 2189 m.& The Brent Group sandstones proved oil bearing. Exact determination of an OWC was not established due to pressure depletion effects, but oil down to (ODT) 2247 m was proven by logs.


Eleven conventional cores were attempted. Nine were recovered in the interval 2194 m - 2408 m (Tarbert and Ness Formation), two in the interval 1950 m - 1959.5 m were unsuccessful, and one was recovered in the interval 1610 m - 1619 m (Hordaland Group). Two FMT segregated samples were taken on wire line at 2223 m (base Tarbert Formation: gas, oil, and water) and one at sample point 2247 (Ness Formation: gas, oil, water, mud). Three runs were made with core gun. One hundred and fifty sidewall cores were attempted, 72 were recovered. The well was permanently abandoned as an oil appraisal on 2 December 1989.


Testing




Two DST tests were carried out in the oil zone. Test no 1 (Ness Formation, 2232.3 m - 2241.3 m) produced fluid at a rate of 960 Sm3/d during the main flow period, with a GOR of 80 Sm3/Sm3. Test no 2 (Tarbert Formation, 2204.7 m - 2210,7 m) produced fluid at a rate of 1150 Sm3/d during main flow, with a GOR of 67 Sm3/Sm3.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 34/7-16
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/7-16 is located between the Statfjord and Snorre Fields on Tampen Spur in the Northern North Sea. The primary purpose of the well was to test the Brent Group reservoir on the C-Plus prospect. A secondary objective was to test the reservoir of the Statfjord Formation. The well was drilled on a high position of the structure and was estimated to reach the reservoir at 2349 m MSL. Shallow gas could occur at 448, 500, and 557 m.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/7-16 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Scarabeo 5 on 13 August 1990 and drilled to TD at 2700 m in the Early Jurassic Amundsen formation. At this depth the well was temporary abandoned due to time schedule for the rig. No significant problems were encountered in the operations. The resistivity log indicated small amounts of gas in a sand layer at 447 m. Otherwise no indication of shallow gas was observed. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 922 m and with KCl mud from 922 m to TD.


Apart from the sandy Utsira Formation of Miocene/Pliocene age encountered between 976 - 1081 m the well penetrated mainly clay stone down to the Top Jurassic. Late Cretaceous (Coniacian age) sediments were found to rest unconformable on the Middle Jurassic Brent Group reservoir at 2390 m. The reservoir was hydrocarbon bearing. From the log, pressure gradient analyses, and FMT sampling the OWC was found at 2487 m, in the Rannoch Formation. Shows were recorded from 2 m above and to 2 m below the oil-bearing reservoir. Weak shows were also observed in the upper part of the Cook Formation.


Eight cores were cut in the well. One core was cut in the Shetland Group, from 1935 to 1953 m, for borehole stability studies. Seven cores were cut in the Brent Group and into the Dunlin Group (8.0 m), in the interval 2389 - 2522 m (driller's depth). The Brent core recovery was 130.8 m, i.e. 98%.
                


Four FMT segregated samples were taken in the Brent Group reservoir and the 1 gallon chambers sent to laboratory. Chamber STO 23 (2392 m) contained oil, while chamber STO 15 (2467.1 m) and chamber STO 24 (2486 m) contained small amounts of oil emulsified with water. Chamber STO 02 (2488 m) was filled with water contaminated with mud filtrate.


The well was suspended on 13 August 1990 for later re-entry and fulfilling of well objectives and testing. It is classified as an oil appraisal on the Vigdis Field.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/7-17
Wellbore history
 








General


Well 34/7-17 is located on the Vigdis Field on Tampen Spur in the Northern North Sea. It was drilled on the southern extension of the C-Plus prospect, on the eastern margin of a complete or non-truncated Brent Group sequence. Furthermore, the location is defined by the down dipping geometry to the northwest, and the proximity to a major fault zone to the south. The primary purpose of the well was to test the reservoir quality and fluid contacts in the prospect. The sequence was drilled in a structural position where a large range of oil-water contacts could be tested. A secondary objective was to test the pressure regimes in the Jurassic sequence, including possible depletion associated with pressure communication, previously identified in the nearby Tordis Field.


Operations and results


Well 34/7-17 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Treasure Saga on 25 February 1991 and drilled to TD at 3115 m in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. Due to leaks in the riser the 26? section was drilled riserless while the riser was sent onshore for repairs. First returns to the rig floor was at 897 m. From the MWD logs possible shallow gas was interpreted at 519 - 520, 576 - 576.5 and 692 -693 m, but flow checks performed proved negative. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 897 m, and with KCl mud from 897 m to TD.


In the Nordland, Hordaland, Rogaland and Shetland Groups, the well penetrated mainly claystones with minor sandstone intervals. Top of the Brent Group reservoir was reached at 2461 m (2458 m TVD), which was 38 m deeper than prognosed. The Jurassic section comprised a minor interval of the Viking Group, and a complete section of the Middle Jurassic Brent Group, the Early Jurassic Dunlin Group and the Statfjord Formation. Both main reservoir targets, the Brent Group and the Statfjord Formation, proved to be water bearing. Scattered oil shows were noted in sandstones in drill cuttings from the Lista Formation (at 1855 to 1900 m). A continuous section with traces of both direct and predominantly crush cut fluorescence was recorded in side wall cores between 2235 and 2405 m. Only scattered shows were recorded on the cores taken in the primary target Brent Group reservoir (at 2467 m and at 2472 to 2481 m). Shows were again noted in sandstone side wall cores from the Amundsen and Statfjord Formations in the interval 2920 to 3080 m.
                


A total of 8 cores were cut in the Brent Group between 2460.0 and 2586.0 m (driller's depth). This makes a total of 126 m, of which 117.05 m were recovered (93%). Two RFT runs were conducted, one in the Lista Formation and one in the Early - Middle Jurasic. The resulting pressure gradients showed three different pressure regimes in the Middle - Early Jurassic, each separated by ca 5 bar pressure. Highest pressure was seen in the Statfjord Formation, medium pressure was seen in the Lower Brent Group and the lowest pressure in the upper Brent Group (Tarbert Formation). Only one (at 1881.5 m) of the pressure measurements taken in the Rogaland Group was reliable, indicating an equivalent pressure gradient of 1.40-1.41 g/cc subsea. One segregated RFT fluid sample was taken at 1881.5 m. The content was reported to be water and mud.


The open hole was plugged back to 2408 m and prepared for sidetracking to a new reservoir target. The well is classified as dry with shows.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 34/7-18
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/7-18 is located on the Vigdis Field on Tampen Spur in the Northern North Sea. It was designed to drill and test a Jurassic Prospect (Segment IV of the C Plus structure), between the Snorre and Tordis Fields. The well was drilled in a high position on a gently dipping structure where the top of the Brent Group is eroded. The primary objective was to test the presence, reservoir quality and fluid contacts in the prospect. A secondary objective was to test the pressure regimes in the Jurassic sequence, including possible depletion associated with pressure communication, previously identified in the nearby Tordis Field. A boulder bed was expected at 303 m, and shallow gas could occur at 394 m and 546 m.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/7-18 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation West Alpha on 20 July 1991 and drilled to TD at 2443 m in the Early Jurassic Drake Formation. Problems with retrieving core no 2 led to 4 days lost while fishing. During plug and abandon the cut and pull tool twisted off and 9 x 8" DC and 7 x 5" HWDP was left on seabed. Three days were lost while clearing the seabed and cutting the casing and retrieving the well head, which was eventually retrieved using explosives. Shallow gas was encountered in the pilot hole and a boulder bed was indicated from drilling parameters at 342 m. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 1115 m, and with KCl mud from 1115 m to TD.


In the Nordland and Hordaland Groups, the well penetrated mainly claystones with relatively minor sandstone intervals. A Paleocene oil discovery was made, and two cores were cut in the Lista Formation, Rogaland Group. These were cut in the interval 1774 -1782 m, of which 6.3 m were recovered. RFT pressure measurements and fluid sampling, the latter without success, were carried out in addition to a drill stem test.
                


The top of the Brent Group reservoir was penetrated at 2284 m which was 20 m shallower than prognosed. The Jurassic section comprised an eroded Middle Jurassic Brent Group and the Early Jurassic Dunlin Group. A total of 3 cores were cut in the Brent Group between 2285 and 2306 m, with a recovery of 20.5 m. The upper part of a sandstone interpreted to be a Ness Formation sandstone (2284 - 2290 m) had traces of oil with a calculated oil saturation up to 25% in the best zones. No oil gradient and hence no OWC could be established from the pressure gradient analysis. Small amounts (40 - 300 ml) of oil were recovered in RFT samples from 2284.5 and 2284.6 m.
                


Apart from the zones with live oil minor shows were recorded in sand layers in the interval 1375 to 1585 m in the Hordaland Group and in siltstone laminae in the interval 2120 to 2250 m in the Shetland Group. No shows were recorded below 2288.5 m.


The pressure gradient of the Brent Group showed the same depletion as observed in well 34/7-17A, indicating pressure communication in the Lower Brent between the Tordis Field, well 34/7-17A and well 34/7-18.


The well was permanently abandoned on 17 September 19921 as a minor oil discovery.


Testing




One DST test was performed in the interval 1770 - 1783.5 m in an intra-Lista Formation Sandstone. The maximum oil rate was 130 Sm3/day. Due to sand and clay plugging, flow was sluggish and reliable rates were not obtained. The well test summary reports 46 Sm3oil/day as a reference rate, measured during the main flow through a 7.9 mm choke. A gas rate of ca 9000 Sm3 /day was measured at the same time. Maximum down hole temperature measured in the test was 60.9 deg C.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 34/7-19
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/7-19 is an appraisal well on the Vigdis Middle structure, south of the Snorre Field on Tampen Spur in the Northern North Sea. The well was drilled approximately 1.5 km north-west of well 34/7-16, on a north-west dipping, rotated fault block. A wedge of partially eroded Viking Group/Heather Formation was interpreted above the reservoir. The primary objectives of the well were to prove the north-western extension of the 34/7-16 reservoir into Segment M1 of the Vigdis Middle and establish an oil water contact for the upper Brent Group. A secondary objective was to test the possible existence of a Late Jurassic Draupne Formation shale wedge. The well was designed to be used in possible future field development. Shallow gas was expected at a depth of 445 m on the well location. This level represents a sand layer at Top Pliocene where gas had been observed in several previous wells in block 34/7. Shallow gas could also be expected in thin sand layers, below seismic resolution down to Top Utsira Formation. A boulder bed could be expected approximately 60 m below sub seabed. Prognosed TD was estimated to 2803 m, and an OWC was assumed at 2418 m (2400 m MSL).


Operations and results


Well 34/7-19 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation West Alpha on 24 September 1991 and drilled to TD at 2800 m in the Early Jurassic Cook Formation. At core point, 2439 m the weather deteriorated. Due to extreme heave the top drive jumped out of hook. The drill pipe bent and the top drive fell down on the drill floor. The shear ram was activated leaving the drill string with core assembly in the hole. Fishing and WOW caused 4.5 days delay before coring could commence. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 1166 m and with KCl mud from 1166 m to TD. Shallow gas was not encountered in this well, but a zone from 526 to 527.5 m was interpreted as potentially gas bearing. One boulder bed was encountered at 363 m.


Down to the Top Jurassic at 2455.5 the well penetrated mainly claystones. An exception to this was the sandy Utsira Formation from 944 to 1065 m. The Jurassic interval comprised the Late Jurassic Heather Formation, the Middle Jurassic Brent Group and the Early Jurassic Dunlin Group.


Well 34/7-19 encountered oil in the Tarbert Formation of the Brent Group. The resistivity logs indicated oil down to 2477 m and water up to 2483 m. The OWC was from the RFT-pressure measurements estimated at 2478 m (2460 mSS). An RFT sample recovered oil at 2465 m. The oil bearing part of the Tarbert Formation (2455.5 - 2478.0 m) had an estimated average log porosity of 0.26, a net to gross ratio of 0.8 and an average water saturation of 39 %. The total Tarbert Formation (2455.5 - 2499.5 m) had an estimated average porosity of 0.25 and a net to gross ratio of 0.67.
                


Sparse oil shows were observed in sandstone lamina and claystones of the Rogaland Group in parts of the interval 1688 -1750 m. Shows were observed in silty and sandy lithologies in the interval 2180 -2300 in the Kyrre Formation. Over the Brent Group reservoir good oil shows were encountered in cores from 2454 - 2482 m. Below 2482 the amount of shows decreased, and below 2486 hydrocarbon shows were not observed.


Ten cores were cut in the interval 2439 - 2661 m, giving full core coverage of the Brent Group. A total of 16.5 m in the Cromer Knoll Group/Heather Formation, 202.5 m in the Brent Group and 3 m of the Dunlin Group was cored. The total core recovery was 211.8 m (95.4 %). One RFT segregated fluid sample was taken at 2465 m. The 2 3/4 gallon chamber recovered 10.3 l water and filtrate with only small amounts of oil and gas (0.2 l and 7 l, respectively). The content of the 1 gallon chamber had a similar composition.
                


The well was suspended 27 December 1991 as a possible future development well. It is classified as an oil appraisal.


Testing


Two drill stem tests were performed in this well.
                


DST 1 perforated and tested the interval 2542 to 2557 m in the water bearing Etive Formation. The maximum stable production rate during main flow was 466 Sm3 water/day. Initial reservoir pressure and temperature, at sensor depth (2487.7 m), was measured to 369.2 bar and 86 deg C.
                


DST 2 perforated and tested the interval 2455.3 to 2468.3 m in the oil bearing part of the Tarbert Formation. Maximum stable production rate was 1070 fluid Sm3/day through a 14.3 mm choke. The produced fluid was oil with a GOR of 42 Sm3/Sm3. The oil density was 0.835 g/cm3 and the gas gravity was 0.700 (air = 1). Initial pressure and temperature, at sensor depth (2414.2 m), was measured to 361.8 bar and 83 deg C, respectively.

Well: 34/7-20
Wellbore history
 





General


Exploration well 34/7-20 is located between the Snorre and the Statfjord Nord Field on Tampen Spur in the Northern North Sea. The well is positioned up-dip on a gently west-dipping structure that includes a supposed thin Late Jurassic sand interval. The primary objective was this Late Jurassic sand in a pinch-out trap. A secondary objective was to test the Brent Group, and if water-bearing, make a pressure test in order to evaluate possible communication to the Vigdis West Field.
                


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/7-20 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Treasure Saga on 18 July 1992 and drilled to TD at 3177 m in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. The 12 1/4" section was drilled with slow penetration rates, frequent wiper trips, and frequent change of drill bits. After a bit change, the new BHA went stuck at 2724 m while running in the hole, and had to be worked free with 110 tons overpull. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 419 m, with gel mud from 419 m to 1220 m, and with KCl mud from 1220 m to TD. Indications of shallow gas were seen at 557 -558 m and at 620 - 621 m.


Down to Base Cretaceous the well penetrated mainly claystones. An exception to this was the sandy Utsira Formation between 961 and 1040 m. The Jurassic interval comprised the prognosed Late Jurassic sandstone and Heather Formation, the Middle Jurassic Brent Group and the Early Jurassic Dunlin Group.
                


The top of the primary target Late Jurassic reservoir was penetrated at 2578 m, 7 meter shallower than prognosed. Only 3 meter of Late Jurassic sand was penetrated and proved water bearing with oil-shows. These were the only shows reported in the well.


Pressure tests in the Brent and Viking Groups in well 34/7-20 indicated communication between the sandstones of the Late Jurassic and Brent Groups. These sandstone units are probably in contact further up-dip, which is, most likely, the explanation to why the well was dry. The Brent Group pressure tests indicated, when compared to the tests from well 34/7-13, a communication within the Brent Group between the NW-Area and the Vigdis West Field. A relatively low pressure in well 34/7-20 indicated pressure depletion from the Statfjord Field. The pressure tests carried out in the Statfjord Formation were compared to the oil pressure tests in wells 34/7-7 and P-33 in the Snorre Field. The results of this comparison indicated a significantly deeper OWC in the Snorre Field than stated prior to the completion of well 34/7-20.


A total of 3 cores were cut from 2576 m in the lowermost Cromer Knoll Group down to 2637 m in the Ness Formation. An RFT segregated fluid sample was taken at 2579.5 m. The 2 3/4 gallon chamber contained 2 l water and filtrate with an oil film.


The well was permanently abandoned on 27 August 1992 as a dry well with shows.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/7-21
Wellbore history
 





General


Exploration well 34/7-21 was drilled the south-western part of block 34/7 on Tampen Spur, on the H-prospect northwest of the Tordis Field. The main objective was to test the hydrocarbon prospectivity within the Late Jurassic (Viking Group) interval. The target was a Late Jurassic sand wedge, truncated in the up-dip direction towards the east by the Base Cretaceous Unconformity. Sufficient amounts of reservoir sand were conditioned by erosion and re-sedimentation from the underlying Middle Jurassic Brent Group, which is progressively truncated up-dip in the same direction. The secondary objective was to test the Paleocene in which an oil discovery had been made in well 34/7-18.


Operations and results


Well 34/7-21 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Treasure Saga on 19 October 1992 and drilled to TD at 3015 m in the Early Jurassic Drake Formation. Tight and sticky formation was reported in the 12 1/4" section, but no significant technical problems occurred in the operations. Based on the site survey, possible shallow gas was predicted at 298, 548 and 612 m. The MWD confirmed a gas bearing sand at 541 m - 548 m. A flow check proved negative. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 1113 m and with KCl polymer mud from 1113 m to TD.
                


In the Nordland, Hordaland, and Upper Rogaland Groups, the well penetrated mainly clay/claystone with minor sand, except for the sandy Utsira Formation between 929-1040 m. At the base of the Rogaland Group, the Lista Formation sandstone was encountered and proven dry, but with shows. In the Shetland and the condensed Cromer Knoll Group, claystone with limestone beds and massive marls/limestones were penetrated, respectively. A hydrocarbon-bearing interval was proven in a sand in the Cromer Knoll at 2498-2501 m. The top of the Late Jurassic reservoir was reached at 2508 m, which was 29 m shallower than prognosed. Within the Draupne Formation, two separate oil bearing sandstone intervals were proven between 2508-2545 m and between 2565.5-2569 m. The latter contained high concentrations of H2S. All three hydrocarbon bearing intervals had separate formation pressure regimes, and did not communicate. No OWC was identified at any level. The overall ODT was 2569 m (2543 m MSL).


Apart from the three hydrocarbon bearing reservoirs shows were reported in several intervals. In the base of the Rogaland Group, traces of good oil shows were detected in argillaceous sandstones (intra Lista Formation) at 1850-1858 m. In the Shetland Group, good oil shows occurred in thin sandstone horizons from about 2270 m. The shows in this interval decreased progressively from below 2425 m. In the top of the Heather Formation, traces of weak oil shows was identified in a siltstone bed at 2587.5-2588.5 m. No shows were reported below this depth.


A total of 5 cores were cut in well 34/7-21. Core 1 was cut in the interval 1858 to 1885.7 m in the Sele/Lista Formations. Cores 2-5 were cut in the Draupne Formation and down into the top of the Heather Formation, at 2515 to 2594 m.
                


FMT fluid samples were taken at 2498.5 m (oil), 2529.7 m (oil), and at 2567.5 m (two samples in different runs, both with oil).


After testing the well was plugged back and prepared for sidetracking to explore the extension of the Late Jurassic reservoirs. The plugged back hole was permanently abandoned on 11 December 1992 and the well was classified as an oil discovery.


Testing


The interval 2510.5-2537.5 m, covering the main part of the upper Intra-Draupne Sand, was perforated and tested. The oil rate at the end of the second main flow was measured to 884 Sm3/day through a 12.7 mm choke. The corresponding wellhead pressure was 146 bar and the GOR was 95 Sm/Sm3, while the dead oil density was 0.85 g cm3 and the gas gravity was 0.89 (air = 1). The reported bottom hole temperature/reservoir temperature from the test was 91 deg C.

Well: 34/7-22
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/7-22 is located between the Gullfaks and Snorre fields on Tampen Spur in the Northern North Sea. The main objective was to prove hydrocarbons and reservoir quality of a Brent Group prospect named the STWB prospect, defined by structural closure towards east and north, dip closure towards south, combined with fault seal against the Main Tordis Fault (MTF) towards west. Sands within Paleocene, Cretaceous, and Late Jurassic were secondary objectives.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/7-22 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation West Delta on 15 August 1993 and drilled to TD at 2507 m in the Early Jurassic Drake Formation. Since possible shallow gas levels had been predicted, a 9 7/8" pilot hole was drilled. The Nordland Group consisted mainly of claystone except for the sandy Utsira Formation, which came in at 907 m. On the seismic, top Hordaland was interpreted to coincide with a structural high which was considered to be a clay diapir. The "clay diapir" consisted, however, almost entirely of sandstone which partly belongs to the Utsira Formation and the upper part of the Hordaland Group. The unexpected large amounts of sand caused operational problems due to instability and the drill string got stuck at 1086 m, on 17 August. The string was backed off and the well was re-spudded on 18 August. The casing program was re-designed to penetrate and stabilize the sandy Utsira Formation and Hordaland Group with a weighted mud system. After re-spud, drilling commenced as planned. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 1329 m, and with KCl mud with glycol from 1329 m to TD.


No sand or hydrocarbons were found within the Paleocene and Cretaceous (Campanian) intervals, but at 2178.5 m, a water wet Intra-Draupne Formation sand was penetrated. At 2184 m the Heather Formation was encountered with a thickness of 40 m, 31m thicker than prognosed. Top reservoir, corresponding to Top Tarbert Formation, Brent Group, was encountered at 2224 m and was proven oil bearing down to 2249.5 m, with good to excellent reservoir quality as proven by cores, electrical logs and the test. FMT pressure points showed that the Tarbert Formation reservoir was in a separate pressure regime from the underlying Ness-Etive-Rannoch Formations, and also from the above Intra Draupne Sandstone.


Apart from the live oil in the Tarbert Formation reservoir there were weak shows in claystones in the interval 2080 - 2176 in the Shetland Group. Similar shows were observed in the Late Jurassic Intra Draupne Formation sand and in the Heather Formation. Below the OWC in the Tarbert reservoir shows continued down to 2256 m. There were no shows below 2256 m.


A total of 7 cores were cut in the interval 2226 - 2331.5 m in Tarbert and Ness Formations. Segregated samples of oil and gas were obtained at 2228.5 m and 2246.3 m in the Tarbert Formation.
                


The well was permanently abandoned on 1 October 1993 as an oil discovery.


Testing


One well test was performed in the Tarbert Formation in the interval 2236 - 2242 m. In the final stage of the main flow period the well flowed 1154 Sm3 oil/day through a 14.3 mm choke. The oil had a GOR of 47 Sm3/Sm3, a dead oil density of 0.85 g/cm3 and the gas gravity was 0.695 (air = 1). The maximum recorded temperature in the test was 84.5 deg C.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 34/7-23 A
Wellbore history
 





General


Exploration well 34/7-23 A was drilled in the H-Vest prospect as a sidetrack to well 34/7-23 S, located on the Vigdis Field on Tampen Spur in the Northern North Sea. The main objective was to test for Top Draupne Sandstone reservoir presence within the Top Draupne Sequence of Portlandian and Ryazanian age and to test for an oil water contact. Secondary objective was to test for reservoir presence and hydrocarbons in a seismic wedge in the middle Draupne Sequence. Additional targets were lowermost Late Cretaceous and intra Oxfordian (Intra-Heather Formation) sandstones.
                


Operations and results


Well 34/7-23 A was kicked off from well 34/7-23 S on April 8, 1994. The kick off point was at 2358 m (1968.5 m TVD) in the upper part of the Shetland Group. The well was drilled westward deviated to TD at 3412 m (2769 m TVD) using the semi-submersible installation Vildkat Explorer. Drilling went without problem. During logging operations the FMT tool got stuck at 3220 m and 60 hrs were spent fishing for it. The well was drilled with KCl mud with a polyalkyleneglycol additive (BP DCP 208) m from kick-off to TD.


In the Shetland Group claystones with limestone beds were penetrated. The condensed Cromer Knoll Group consisted of marls, limestones and minor claystones. The Viking Group was encountered at 3202.9 m (2619 m TVD). The topmost section was oil bearing Intra Draupne Formation sandstone from 3202.9 to 3246 m (2619 - 2649.1 TVD, 30.1 m gross). This sandstone interval, which was the only sandstone interval encountered within the Draupne Formation, proved an ODT at 3246 m (2649.1 m TVD). No OWC was identified on the logs or with the FMT-measurements. The Intra Draupne Formation Sandstone reservoir had an estimated average log porosity of 22.4% and an estimated average water saturation of 11.4%. The net gross ratio was 0.93. Below the reservoir, the Draupne Formation consisted of siltstones and claystones. The Middle to Late Jurassic Heather Formation penetrated by the well consisted of sandy silty claystones with only minor limestone and sandstone beds.


Five cores were cut with a 90 ft core barrel from 3199 to 3291 m in the Intra Draupne Formation Sandstone and into the Draupne Formation. H2S was present when recovering core No 1 and 2 (200 and 300 ppm H2S, respectively). No H2S was measured in the three lowermost cores. Due to the FMT problems no fluid samples were taken.
                


The well was permanently abandoned on 20 May as an oil appraisal.


Testing


The interval 3205.0-3225.0 m (2622-2635 m TVD) in the Intra-Draupne Formation sand was perforated and tested. The oil rate at the end of the multi-rate flow was measured to 1085 Sm3/day through a 19.1 mm choke, with a corresponding wellhead pressure of 97.5 bar and a GOR of 106 Sm3/Sm3 at separator conditions of 42.9 bar and 58.9 deg C. The dead oil density was 0.848 g/cm3 and the gas gravity was 0.71 (air = 1). A maximum H2S concentration of 0.8 ppm was measured. Maximum bottom hole temperature measured

Well: 34/7-24 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well is located east of the Statfjord Øst field and west of the Vigdis and Tordis Fields in the Tampen area in the Northern North Sea. The main objective of the well was to prove presence of sandstone and hydrocarbons in the Draupne Formation. The wells earlier drilled in the H-Area, 34/7-21, -21 A in H-Sentral and -23 S and -23A in H-Vest, proved oil bearing Late Jurassic Intra Draupne Formation sand. The discoveries in H-Sentral and H-Vest were however not in direct pressure communication. Well 34/7-24 S was drilled in a structural low compared to the other wells in the area and was mainly designed to test the continuity of the discovery made in H-Vest 34/7-23 S&A. The 34/7-24 S well was prognosed to penetrate top reservoir 63 m below the deepest penetrated ODT in the area. No OWC had been proved in the H-Area and the 34/7-24 S well was placed structurally relatively deep in order to possible reach an OWC in case of a sand bearing top Draupne interval.
                


Secondary objectives of the well were possible gravity deposited sandstones within the Middle and Lower Draupne Sequences


Operations and results


Well 34/7-24 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Vildkat Explorer on 25 February 1995 and drilled to TD at 3145 m (2938 m TVD) 54 m TVD into Late Jurassic sediments of the Heather Formation. Due to the nearness to the Snorre-Statfjord pipeline at the target position the well had to be drilled deviated. The distance between the spud and the target position at Base Cretaceous level was approximately 900 m. The inclination was built from vertical to 28 deg through the 12 1/4" section from 335 m to 1296 m. Operations went without significant problems. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 1296 m, and with a pseudo-oil based mud system (NOVAMUL) from 1296 m to TD. There was interpreted possible shallow gas from the MWD logs between 361 to 365 m. The zone did not show anything on the ROV or at the flow check.


The Nordland and Hordaland Groups consisted mainly of silty claystones except for the sandy Utsira Formation, which came in at 926 m MD (905 m TVD). The Nordland and Hordaland Groups had the highest content of drilling gas in the well (0.1-0.8), but no signs of gas were seen on the logs, except for the already mentioned shallow gas level. The Rogaland Group was penetrated at 1861 m (1727 m TVD), and consists of the Balder Formation and the Sele/Lista Formation. The Balder Formation was dominated by tuff interbedded with claystone. The Sele/Lista Formation consisted of silty claystones with traces of limestones. There were some weak hydrocarbon shows from 1870 to 1910 m. At 2065 m (1904 m TVD) the Shetland Group was penetrated. The Shetland Group consisted predominantly of silty claystones with some limestones and thin sandstone beds. The Cromer Knoll Group had marl as the main lithology. The marl was interbedded with silty claystones. The Viking Group top reservoir, came in at 2928 m (2721 m TVD) and consisted of claystones interbedded with only minor sandstone beds.
                


No cores were cut. No wire line pressure or fluid samples were taken since no sand was encountered.


The well was permanently abandoned on 24 March 1995 as a dry well.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/7-25 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/7-25 S is located near the southern extension of the Tordis field and North of the Gullfaks field in the Tampen area in the Northern North Sea. The main objective of the well was to test the presence of sand and hydrocarbon in a Late Jurassic prospect (the Southern Triangle Upper Jurassic (STUJ) prospect). The STUJ prospect was defined between Base Cretaceous Unconformity (BCU) and a Base Draupne reflector. Secondary objectives were to obtain pressure measurements in the Brent Group, test presence of sand and hydrocarbons in the Cretaceous and in the Paleocene and prove migration route.


Operations and results


Well 34/7-25 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Bergen on 31 July 1996 and drilled to TD at 3235 m (2596 m TVD) in the Early Jurassic Drake Formation. No significant problems occurred during operations. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 1271 m and with oil based mud (Anco Vert) from 1271 m to TD. No shallow gas was encountered.


Well 34/7-25 S penetrated several sands in the interval from 1250 m to 1700 m within the Hordaland Group. Weak shows were described in the interval 2275 to 2295 m in the Lista Formation. The shows had no odour and no stain in the description, due to oil based mud. The Cretaceous section had only traces of thin sandstone beds in the Shetland Group. The well successfully encountered 27.5 m TVD oil bearing sandstones belonging to the Draupne Formation, with top at 2791 m (2193 m TVD). No OWC was proven. The uppermost 2 m was cemented and had the same log response as the limestone of the Cromer Knoll Group. The next 21 m (2195 - 2216 TVD) showed excellent reservoir properties with porosity around 30% and permeability between 6 and 7 Darcy. This upper massive sandstone was bioturbated and showed a coarsening up character. The lower part of the Draupne Formation comprised sandstones interbedded with more silty parts. This part of the formation had a very high gamma response due to a high content of uranium isotopes. The sand beds in this section had oil shows but petrophysical interpretation concluded that it had no HC saturation. The top Heather Formation was penetrated at 2822 m (2220.5 m TVD). Between the sandy Draupne Formation and the shaly Heather Formation there was an unconformity of Callovian - Volgian age. Pressure measurements in the Late Jurassic showed communication with the Tordis field.


Two cores were cut at 2805 to 2860.2 m within the Viking Group with close to 100 % overall recovery. No wire line fluid samples were taken since the main zone was going to be tested.


The well was permanently abandoned on 14 September 1996 as an oil discovery.


Testing


The interval 2791 - 2816 m (2193.0 - 2214.6 m TVD) in the Intra Draupne Formation sand was perforated and tested. After the clean-up flow and build-up the well was opened for the 48 hour main flow period. The final flow rate was 1045 Sm3 oil and 102200 Sm3 gas/day through a 15.9 mm choke at a wellhead pressure of 124 bar and a GOR of 94 Sm3/m3 at separator conditions. The oil density was 0.844 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was 0.72 (air = 1). The maximum bottom hole temperature in the test was measured to 82 deg C.

Well: 34/7-27
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/7-27 was drilled in the northwestern corner of block 34/7, north of the Sygna and Statfjord North fields. The project was a joint operation involving three licence groups, PL 089, PL 206, and PL 037.


The prospect was the Nordis Nord prospect, which was located immediately to the north of, and in a down flank position from, the Sygna (Nordis) discovery made in wells 33/9-19 S&A (PL 037). The Nordis Nord prospect was defined as a combined structural and stratigraphic trap where the expected hydrocarbon phase was oil.


The main purpose of well 34/7-27 was to test the lithology and presence of hydrocarbons within the sandstone formations of the Brent Group. A secondary purpose of the well was to test a target in the Upper Jurassic, Draupne Formation and obtain pressure measurements in the Upper Jurassic and Brent to identify hydrocarbon communication in the area.


Operations and results


The wildcat well 34/7-27 was drilled with the semi-submersible installation "Byford Dolphin". The well was spudded on 1 September 1998 but, following problems running the 30"; casing, was respudded on 3 September and the well reached TD on 29 September 1998 at 3000 m in the Early Jurassic Drake Formation. The well was drilled with seawater and viscous sweeps down to 905 m and with water based silicate mud ("Barasilc") from 915 m to TD. Sands were encountered in the prospective levels. The well penetrated a 153 m thick Brent Group sequence (2777 - 2930 m) with excellent reservoir properties in the Etive Formation, reaching 28.7 % porosity and 2100 mD in the upper part. The well encountered no hydrocarbons. All penetrated sequences proved to be water filled with no shows. One core was cut in the Draupne and uppermost Heather formation (2742 - 2759 m). No fluid sampling was attempted. Well 34/7-27 was plugged and abandoned as a dry well on 7 October 1998.


Testing
                


No drill stem test was performed

Well: 34/7-28
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/7-28 is located in the Tampen area in the Northern North Sea. It was drilled on a prospect situated north east of the Statfjord Nord field and east of the Snorre field. The well tested the NW III prospect, which was defined as a stratigraphic trap with pinch out of the Draupne Formation. The sands in the Draupne Formation were expected to be erosional products from the Snorre block positioned in a north east direction of the well.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/7-28 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Transocean Leader on 30 December 1997. The well was initially drilled to a total depth of 1267 m in the 12 l/4" section where the decision was made to plug and abandon the well. The abandonment was due to concerns over the integrity of the 18 3/4" wellhead housing, which had suffered damage during BOP latching procedures. At this time a total of 24.9 days had been spent on the well. With the rig moved ca. 25 m NNE from the original location, well 34/7-28 was re-spudded on 24 January 1998 and drilled to TD at 3005 m in the Middle Jurassic Drake Formation. The final 34/7-28 well was drilled with sea water and bentonite hi-vis sweeps down to 1300 m, with silicate mud from 1300 m to 2165 m, and with KCl/glycol mud ("Aqaucol D" polypropylene glycols) from 2165 m to TD.


Apart from the Utsira Formation only traces of sand was penetrated above top Jurassic. Sandstones were encountered in the prospective level of the Viking Group. The uppermost sand at 2666 m was a 3 m thick Intra Draupne Formation sandstone overlying 10 m of Heather Formation shale. The lower sand at 2679 m was a 16 m thick Intra Heather Formation sandstone, interpreted as a gravitation deposit. Both sandstones were penetrated at shallower depth than the oil-water contact in Statfjord Nord and both were water filled. An undifferentiated sequence of water filled Rannoch/Etive Formations sandstones was penetrated from 2805 to 2972 m. Pressure measurements showed that the sands in the Viking group were in communication, but they were not in communication with the sands in the Brent Group. From this it was concluded that the base seal was intact, and the fault to the south west was sealing. Weak shows were described in the core from the Intra Heather Formation sandstone, but subsequent geochemical analyses in the laboratory were not able to confirm this. This was the only indication of hydrocarbons in the well.


Two cores were cut in the Intra Heather Formation sandstone and Heather Formation shale from 2668-2694 m and 2694-2726.5 m. The sands were massive and had good visible porosity. MDT pressure tests were carried out in the Viking Group and in the Brent Group. No fluid sampling was attempted.


The well was permanently abandoned on 3 March 1998 as a dry well.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/7-29 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Exploration well 34/7-29 S was drilled in the west central part of block 34/7 on the H-North prospect. The H-North prospect was located SSE of the Vigdis field and NE of the Statfjord East field. The main objective of well 34/7-29 S was to test a northerly extension of the oil bearing Upper Jurassic Top Draupne Sands penetrated in wells 34/7-21, 21 A, 23 S & 23 A. The well was designed to test the presence of reservoir, hydrocarbons and pressure communication with the other H-Area segments. Reservoir presence was considered the primary risk. Seismic interpretation of the reservoir interval indicated communication with the H-West area, and pressure, sample and DST data were considered important to test this interpretation. In addition the well was to test for the presence of sands and possible hydrocarbons in the Middle and Lower Draupne Formation. Secondary objectives were to test the lithology and depositional model of the Palaeocene Lista Formation and tie the Top Brent seismic marker.


Operations and results


Exploration well 34/7-29 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation "Transocean Leader" on 4 March 1998 and drilled and cored to TD at 2927 m (2848 m TVD RKB) in the 8 1/2" hole section 30 m into the Middle Jurassic Brent Group. A 7" liner was set and cemented. The well was drilled with Sea water and bentonite sweeps down to 1211 m and with "AQUACOL D" KCl / Glycol mud from 1211 m to 2558 m, and with "ANTISOL D" PAC mud from 2558 m to TD. Due to the presence of hydrocarbons and the requirement for the rig to go on contract for Norsk Hydro, the well was suspended on 14 April 1998 as an oil discovery. The semi-submersible drilling installation "Deepsea Bergen" re-entered well 34/7-29 S R on 22 February 1999 for testing.
                


In the Nordland, Hordaland and Rogaland Groups the well penetrated mainly clay/claystones with some beds of sand. The Heimdal equivalent Member between 1928 -1999 m (1864 -1933 m TVD RKB) contained thick water wet sands. In the Shetland Group claystones and limestone beds were penetrated. The condensed Cromer Knoll Group consisted of marls, limestones and minor claystones. Core point was reached in the Cromer Knoll Group at 2701 m. The first core (2701 - 2718 m) penetrated the top of the Top intra Draupne Sand at 2705 m (2627 m TVD RKB) and contained oil bearing sands at the base. A second core was cut from 2718 to 2726 m from within the intra Draupne Sands and into the Draupne Shale. In total 17,7 m of sands were penetrated. MDT pressure samples acquired during logging indicated that the sands were all oil bearing and oil down to (ODT) of 2723 m (2622 m TVD MSL) was proved. No sands were penetrated within the Draupne Shale. Fluid samples proved the reservoir fluid to be undersaturated oil. The fluid samples were taken during the MDT run, using the Pump-Out module in combination with the Optical Fluid Analyser to limit contamination of mud filtrate. All fluid samples were taken at 2706.5 m. The quality of the samples and analyses was assumed to be good, because no significant differences were observed between the experimental results. Well 34/7-29 S R was permanently abandoned as an oil discovery on 17 March 1999.


Testing
                


One zone in the intra Draupne Sandstone was tested, from 2704 - 2716 m. After clean-up pressure build-up period of 6.2 hours, the well was opened on a 6,4 mm (16/64") adjustable choke, for the main flow, through the heater. The choke size was increased in steps to 17,5 mm (44/64") fixed choke in about 1.5 hours. The flow was directed through the separator 0.75 hours after the well was opened. The main flow had a duration of 72 hours during which the oil rate decreased gradually from 920 Sm3/d to 875 m3/d. The wellhead pressure decreased from 84.0 bars to 80.6 bars during the same period. Final gas rate was 120000 m3/day, giving a GOR of 137 m3/m3. The oil density was 0.842 g/cm3. Bottom hole sampling after flowing was cancelled.

Well: 34/7-30 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/7-30 S is located in the western part of the Southern Triangle Upper Jurassic (STUJ) prospect, segment 2. The prospect is situated in the Southern Triangle, which is confined to the south by the Gullfaks Field and to the east and north by the northern extension of the NW-SE trending Gullfaks Fault and southern part of the Inner Snorre Fault. To the west, the main Tordis Fault separates the Southern Triangle from the Tordis Field. Well 34/7-30-S was a "Drill test well". Its main purpose was to perform an acceptance test of Bideford Dolphins "ramrig" operational performance. The re-entry 34/7-30 SR had a conventional purpose: data acquisition in order to appraise oil reserves in the Draupne Sand in STUJ segment 2.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/7-30 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation "Bideford Dolphin" on 26 May 1999 and drilled to 1148 m (1141.8 m TVD RKB) where it was suspended.& The well was re-entered (34/7-30 S R) with the semi-submersible installation "Scarabeo-5" on 11 November 1999 and drilled to 1365 m MD. Due to drilling problems the well was plugged back and a technical sidetrack (34/7-30 S R T2) was kicked off at 1245 m. The well was finally drilled to 2478 m (2269.2 m TVD RKB) into rocks of Late Jurassic age (Heather Formation). Water based PAC mud was used down to 1148 m and &NOVATEC& oil based (olefins) was used from 1148 m to TD. The expected reservoir section, the Upper Draupne Sand, was not found in this well. One core was cut over the possible reservoir interval situated just below the Cromer Knoll Group from 2403 - 2448 m but only claystones and silty claystones of the Heather Formation were penetrated. Five FMT pre-test pressure measurements were attempted between 2399.5 m and 2400.5 m MD. All five pre-tests measurements were tight and no fluid samples were taken. The well was permanently abandoned as a dry appraisal well on 2 December 1999.

Well: 34/7-31
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/7-31 was drilled in the Borg structure, which is situated on the western side of the Vigdis and Tordis Fields. The primary objective was to appraise the 34/7-23 Discovery in Intra-Draupne Formation Sandstone in this structure. Proven reserves, if sufficient, would most probably be produced through the Vigdis Field installations. Secondary objectives were Paleocene sand (Sele/Lista Formations) in a down-flank position from well 34/7-18 were these sands were oil-filled, and Early Cretaceous sands, found oil filled in well 34/7-21. The well was to be drilled 50 m into the Brent Group, which was expected to be water bearing at well location. In case of encountering an oil-filled Intra-Draupne sand thicker than 10 m TVD in the well, a sidetrack should be drilled, kicked off below the 13 3/8" casing to further appraise the Borg structure.


Operations and results


Well 34/7-31 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Scarabeo 6 on 10 March 2001 and drilled to TD at 2650 m in the Middle Jurassic Tarbert Formation. A 9 7/8" pilot hole was drilled from seabed 233 m to 1150 m. Logs (MWD) presented from seabed 233 m to 1150 m were recorded in the 9-7/8" pilot hole. The 9 7/8" pilot hole was then opened to 36" and 30" casing run to 306 m. The 26" hole (using 26" hole opener) deviated from the original 9 7/8" pilot hole below 306 m and the two holes were ca 27 m apart at 1150 m. Well 34/7-31 was drilled with returns to Seabed down to 1150 m. Sampling started at 1170 m. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to1150 m, and with Glydril KCl/polymer mud from 1150 m to TD. No gas related problems were experienced in the well. However, the MWD logs show possible gas levels at 280 m - 282 m, 372 m - 374,5 m and 558 m - 561 m.


The Intra-Draupne Formation Sandstone was encountered at 2470 with ca 35 meters net oil-bearing reservoir. Then, fourteen m of Draupne Formation shale was penetrated before entering the Heather formation. For the secondary objectives, both were water-filled and only Brent had significant sand (Tarbert Formation). Pressure points were taken with the MDT-tool in order to obtain formation pressures and fluid gradients from all reservoirs encountered in well 34/7-31. Especially the degree of depletion in the Intra-Draupne Sandstone was regarded as crucial information. The measured Intra-Draupne reservoir pressure was the same as the shut-in pressure in the Main Borg field. The gradient and reservoir fluid density was well defined, 0.69 g/cc or 0.067 bars/meter, and the reservoir pressure was measured to 307.04 bar at 2494.7 m. There was an ODT situation; hence the OWC is still not defined. Six high quality MDT oil samples were recovered from the Draupne Formation at 2496 m. Four of these were 250 cc single-phase samples. Two conventional cores were cut from 2472 m to 2506m in the Intra-Draupne Formation Sandstone.


The well bore was plugged back to the 13 3/8" casing and permanently abandoned on 13 April 2001 as an oil Appraisal well.

Well: 34/7-32
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/7-32 was drilled on the Xenon structure on Tampen Spur ca 2 km west of the Snorre Field in the North Sea. The objective was to test the hydrocarbon potential in the Middle Jurassic Brent Group. The well was planned and drilled as a "smart well" i.e. with a reduced data acquisition programme if dry.
                


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/7-32 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation on 9 October 2001 and drilled to TD at 2651 m in Middle Jurassic rocks of the Drake Formation. A 17 1/2" pilot hole was drilled from 384 m to 700 m to check for shallow gas. No shallow gas was observed. The well was drilled with sea water and hi-vis pills down to 1385 m and with Versavert oil based mud from 1385 m to TD. No significant problem was encountered in the operations. Total rig time from spud to P&A was 20 days, including two days wait-on-weather.


The sandstones in the Brent Group proved to be water bearing, with a water gradient of 1.00 g/cm3. No shows were observed.


No cores were cut. Wire line logging consisted of one run (MDT-GR-ECRD) from 2616 m to 2538 m. Seven pressure points were acquired, no fluid sample was taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 27 October 2001 as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/7-33
Wellbore history
 








General


Well 34/7-33 was drilled in the Vigdis/Tordis area on Tampen Spur in the Northern North Sea. The primary objective was to test the potential for oil in the sandstones of the Brent Group in the M5 Sør prospect. The secondary target of the well was to acquire data to clarify the potential of the Sele /Lista interval, if reservoir with hydrocarbon was present and to acquire data over the Utsira Formation Sandstones in order to evaluate the potential for future injection of produced water from the Tordis Field sub-sea separator.


Operations and results


An 8 1/2" pilot hole, well 34/7-U-17, was drilled to evaluate for shallow gas and to log the Utsira Formation. Based on MWD/LWD and ROV indications shallow gas was observed in intervals from 336 to 340 m and between 548 to 550 m. No indications of shallow gas were however observed in the subsequent 36" and 26" hole in well 34/7-33.
                


Wildcat well 34/7-33 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Ocean Vanguard on 16 August 2008 and drilled to TD at 2615 m in the Early Jurassic Drake Formation. Due to flash setting of the cement when cementing the 9 5/8" casing the well was side-tracked (34/7-33 T2), with KOP at 1592 m. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 1053 m, with KCl/polymer mud from 1053 m to 1690 m, with HP/WBM mud from 1690 m to 2260 m, and with KCL/Polymer/glycol mud from 2260 m to TD.


The well penetrated rocks of Quaternary, Tertiary, Cretaceous, and Jurassic age. The well proved approximately 10 meters oil bearing sandstones in the Lista Formation. Cores were taken and good shows were recorded in the sand beds in these cores. Well results suggest that only 1 of the 10 meters sandy interval had properties as a producible reservoir. Gas peaks with a full range of C1 to C5 were recorded in the Balder and Lista Formation, and in the underlying Shetland Group increased gas levels (2-3%) with C1 to C5 were recorded in the interval 2150 to 2220 m. The well further proved, unexpectedly, the presence of Early Cretaceous and Heather age sands resting directly on the Brent Group Ness Formation. The uppermost Tarbert Formation of the Brent Group was not seen in the 34/7-33 T2 well. The reservoir sections in the Brent Group had excellent reservoir properties, as expected, but were water wet with only weak shows at 2392 to 2402 m and 2506 to 2522 m.


Two cores were cut before sidetracking from 1772 m to 1825 m in the Lista Formation. MDT pressure points were attempted before sidetracking in the Lista Formation but only three were obtained due to the thin sandstones encountered. A reliable gradient could not be established. Oil samples were taken at 1801.8 m but due to high drawdown the fluids obtained were not representative. A Mini DST was also attempted in the thin Lista Formation sands, but was not successful. A second MDT run in the sidetrack in the Viking and Brent groups obtained high quality pressure points. Several pressure barriers were indicated by these data. Good water samples were obtained at 2333 m.


The well was permanently abandoned on 15 October as a well with good shows.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/7-34
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/7-34 was drilled on the Vigdis Nordøst prospect located centrally in Block 34/7 on the Tampen Spur in the northern North Sea. The primary objective was to prove commercial volumes of oil in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation. In addition, the Late Jurassic Draupne Formation was listed as a possible secondary target as Intra-Draupne sandstone was encountered in the 34/7-8 discovery well on the Vigdis øst Field.


Operations and results


A 9 7/8" pilot hole, well 34/7-U-18, was drilled to evaluate for shallow gas, as two potential shallow gas warnings, class 1, were given to the well.


Based on MWD/LWD logs water filled sands were encountered at the following depths: 377 m, 452 m, 562 m, 597 m, and 602 m. No indication of shallow gas at seabed was verified with the ROV. Neither were any indications of shallow gas observed at surface or measured while drilling the 36" and 17 1/2" hole in well 34/7-34.


Wildcat well 34/7-34 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Borgland Dolphin on 14 February 2009 and drilled to TD at 2701 m in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. No significant technical problems were encountered in the operations. The well was drilled with seawater and pre-hydrated bentonite sweeps down to 1189 m and with XP-07 oil based mud from 1189 m to TD.


The well penetrated rocks of Quaternary, Tertiary, Cretaceous, Jurassic, and Triassic age. It penetrated the southern local high of the Vigdis Nordøst structure in a downflank position. The well indicated the presence of hydrocarbons in the Shetland and shows were described from 2210 m to 2290 m in thin sandstone beds. Surprisingly, neither the Cromer Knoll, nor any Viking Group was present in the well; the well penetrated directly from the Shetland Group and into the Amundsen shale of the Dunlin Group. The well penetrated oil-bearing Statfjord Formation sandstones at 2460.5 m. Oil was present down to 2514 m. No oil/water contact could be seen, and a sidetrack was decided. No shows were described below 2514 m.


One core was cut from 2473 m to 2502 m in the Statfjord Formation. MDT oil samples were collected in the Statfjord Formation at 2470.5 m (good quality, 8 bar draw-down) and 2502.5 m (86 bar draw-down and 6 - 8% mud contamination).


The well bore was permanently plugged back and abandoned on 10 March 2009 as an oil discovery.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/10-1
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-1 was the first well to be drilled on the "Delta structure" (Gullfaks fault block) in the Northern North Sea. The primary objective of the well was to penetrate sandstones of Early to Middle Jurassic age and to evaluate their possible content of hydrocarbons.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/10-1 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Ross Rig on 20 June 1978 and drilled to TD at 2460 m in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. The 30" casing was set after considerable difficulty in getting through a section of boulders. A severe well kick was taken after a flow check at 1780 m, ca 3 m above top reservoir. Ca 440 barrels of mud were gained in the pit. Otherwise the operations proceeded without significant problems. No directional survey was run below1737 m. The well was drilled with seawater and gel slugs down to 214 m, with fresh water and gel from 214 m to 504 m, with seawater/gel/lignosulphonate from 504 m to 1970 m and with Seawater/gel/spersene/XP20 from 1970 m to TD.


First oil show, pale yellow fluorescence in limestone and siltstone, was recorded at 1370 m in the Hordaland Group. Similar shows continued down to top Brent Group level interrupted only by a short interval of no shows from 1579 to 1600 m. At 1555 in the Balder Formation trace oil in the mud was observed. Top reservoir, Tarbert Formation, was encountered at 1783 m directly underlying the Late Cretaceous Shetland Group. Oil was proven in sandstones all through the Middle Jurassic Brent Group down to top Drake Formation in the Dunlin Group. The oil/water contact was not observed in the well. Below reservoir level shows decreased and died out completely below 2325 m.
                


A total of 12 cores were recovered in the interval from 1782.0 to 1951.1 m and one core from 2232.5 to 2250.5 m. Three runs were made with the RFT and samples were taken at 1871 m (oil) and 2244 m (water, mud and mud filtrate).


The well was permanently abandoned on 8 September as an oil discovery.


Testing




Three drill stem tests were conducted in the Brent Formation.


DST 1 perforated the interval 1930 to 1935 m in the Rannoch Formation and produced 191 Sm3 oil and 20560 Sm3 gas /day through a 32/64" choke. No water was produced. The GOR was 108 Sm3/Sm3, the oil gravity was 28.9 deg API, and the gas gravity was 0.632 (air = 1).
                


DST 2 perforated the interval 1839 to 1844 m in the Etive Formation and produced 1049 Sm3 oil and 86930 Sm3 gas /day through a 36/64" choke. No water was produced. The GOR was 83 Sm3/Sm3, the oil gravity was 28.4 deg API, and the gas gravity was 0.61 (air = 1). The maximum bottom hole temperature recorded in the test was 71.7 deg C.


DST 3 perforated the interval 1788 to 1792 m in the Tarbert Formation and produced 323 Sm3 oil and 29365 Sm3 gas /day through a 17/64" choke. No water was produced. The GOR was 91 Sm3/Sm3, the oil gravity was 29 deg API, and the gas gravity was 0.62 (air = 1). The maximum bottom hole temperature recorded in the test was 69 deg C.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 34/10-2
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-2 was drilled on the "Alpha closure" in the northern North Sea, ca 8 km south of the 34/10-1 Gullfaks discovery drilled three months earlier on the "Delta structure". The primary objective of 34/10-2 well was to test sandstones of the Middle Jurassic series. The secondary objectives were sandstones of the Paleocene and Early Jurassic series.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/10-2 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Ross Rig on 9 September 1978 and drilled to TD at 3729 m in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. No significant problem was encountered during drilling, but close to15 days were spent as WOW due to severe weather conditions, and final logging at TD suffered from the weather. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 517 m, with gel/lignosulphonate mud from 517 m to 1723 m, and with gel/lignosulphonate/"ADF Chrome Lignite" mud from 1723 m to TD.


Well 34/10-2 proved the presence of gas in sandstones of Middle Jurassic Brent Group and oil in sandstones of the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation. The Brent Group was hydrocarbon bearing all through from top at 2944 m down to top Dunlin Group (Drake Formation) at 3124 m. A total of 109 m was net pay sandstone with average porosity 20.8% and average water saturation 13.8%. The gas/oil/water contact was not seen. The Statfjord Formation was oil bearing from 3325 m down to ca 3390 m based on the well logs. It contained 31.75 m of net pay oil bearing sandstone with average porosity 15.9% and average water saturation 21.6%.
                


Shows started at 1640 m. These were described typically as gold yellow fluorescence and fast streaming milky cut on claystones with trace sandstone. These shows continued down to 1845 m. From there and down to top Brent reservoir level only occasional fluorescence in limestone was recorded. Below the OWC in the Statfjord Formation shows on sandstones were recorded down t a depth of 3500 m.
                


A total of eight cores were cut; two in the Middle Jurassic Ness and Rannoch formations and six in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation. An attempt to run the RFT was made but failed, so no pressure points or fluid samples were taken on wire line.


The well was suspended on 8 December 1978 as an oil and gas discovery well.


Testing




Testing was postponed to a later re-entry.





Re-entry


The well was re-entered with the semi-submersible installation Ross Rig on 8 July 1979. The purpose was formation testing and to take fluid samples


No significant problems occurred in the operations
                


No new formation was drilled.
                


The RFT was run on wire line and pressure points and fluid samples were taken. Fluid samples were taken at 2964.5 m, 3024 m, 3105 m, and at 3592 m. Based on the pressure data and DST the OWC in the Statfjord Formation was estimated to be at 3385 m.


The well was permanently abandoned on 10 August 1979.


Testing




Five drill stem tests were performed in the well.


DST 1 tested the interval 3385 - 3395 m in the Statfjord Formation. It produced pure water at rates declining from 700 m3 to 570 m3 /day through a 48/64" choke. The bottom hole maximum temperature in the main flow was 130.6 deg C.


DST 2 tested the interval 3355 - 3365 m in the Statfjord Formation. The main flow was shut in too early due to a leak and was partly a failure. The production rate on a 48/64" choke was estimated tentatively to be ca 127 Sm3 oil and 19000 Sm3 gas/day with a GOR of 150 Sm3/Sm3. The oil gravity was 32.2 deg API and the gas gravity was 0.678 (air = 1). The bottom hole maximum temperature before shut-in was 128.9 deg C.


DST 3 tested the interval 3335 - 3345 m in the Statfjord Formation. The first attempt was unsuccessful as the sand screen got plugged. The second attempt, DST 3 A, was run without sand screen. DST 3A produced on average 127 Sm3 oil and 19800 Sm3 gas /day through a 48/64" choke in the final flow. Ca 2% water cut was measured at goos neck. The GOR was ca 155 Sm3/Sm3, the oil gravity was 32 deg API and the gas gravity was 0.696 (air = 1). The bottom hole maximum temperature in the main flow was 125 deg C.


DST 4 tested the interval 3110 - 3115 in the Rannoch Formation. During the final flow the well was produced at a metered gas rate of about 96300 Sm3 /day on a 20/64" choke. Tank measurement indicated a condensate rate of about 12 Sm3/day and a water rate of about 6 m3/day. The gas/condensate ratio was ca 8000 Sm3/Sm3, the oil gravity was 48 deg API, and the gas gravity was 0.652 (air = 1). The bottom hole maximum temperature was 110 deg C.


DST 5 tested the interval 3017 - 3022 m in the Ness Formation. The well produced in the final flow through 2 x 20/64" choke in parallel 733400 Sm3 gas/day with a condensate rate in the range 175 - 240 Sm3 /day and a corresponding gas/condensate ratio of 3100 - 4200 Sm3/Sm3. The oil gravity was 43 deg API and the gas gravity was 0.645 (air = 1). The bottom hole maximum temperature was 115 deg C.

Well: 34/10-3
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-3 was the second well drilled in the Delta closure in block 34/10


in the Northern North Sea
.  In the first well, 34/10-1, hydrocarbons were tested and proven to be present throughout the Brent sand.
                
The primary objective of the well
                
34/10-3
                
was to test sandstones of Middle Jurassic age. Secondary objectives were sandstones of Early Jurassic and Late Triassic age.


Operations and results


Well was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Norskald on 14 March 1979 and drilled to TD at 2802 m. When coring for core no 10 the core jammed at 2512.5 m and the core head matrix was left in the hole. Fishing commenced for 3 and a half day until most of it was recovered. Otherwise the operation proceeded without any significant problem. The well was drilled with seawater/gel down to 587 m and with Chrome Lignosulphonate mud from 587 m to TD.


Oil shows (yellow fluorescence, cut and "dead oil stain" were recorded at 1410 - 1470 m at the base of the Hordaland Group. Stronger shows were seen from 1814 m in the Shetland Group m and down to top Brent reservoir. Oil in the mud was observed at 1814 m. The Middle Jurassic Brent Group was encountered at 1892 m, directly underlying a thin Albian-Aptian age Cromer Knoll section. The Brent Group was oil bearing down to the oil water contact at 1972 m. Oil shows on cores continued down to 1997 m.
                


Eight cores were cut in succession from 1904 m to 2025 m in the Brent Group, and one core was cut from 2467 m to 2478.8 m in the Early Jurassic Amundsen Formation. No wire line fluid samples were taken due to problems with sand plugging.


The well was suspended on 7 June 1979 as an oil appraisal well.


Testing




Three drill stem tests were conducted in the Brent Group, one water test and two oil tests. Sand production was a problem in the tests.


DST 1 perforated the interval 1990 to 1995 in the water zone. It produced 420 m3 water/day through a 20/64" choke. The water density was 1.0294 g/cm3. The bottom hole maximum temperature was 75.5 deg C, measured at 1973 m.


DST 2 perforated the interval 1935 to 1940 m. It produced 450 Sm3 oil and 33000 Sm3 gad /day through two parallel chokes of diameters 20/64" and 10 /64". The GOR was 70 Sm3/Sm3, the oil gravity was 29.2 deg API, and the gas gravity was 0.656 (air = 1). The bottom hole maximum temperature was 72 deg C, measured at 1915 m.
                


DST 3 perforated the interval 1895 to 1900 m. It produced 103 Sm3 oil/day. The gas rate was not recorded. The oil gravity was 29 deg API. The bottom hole maximum temperature was 69.5 deg C, measured at 1871 m.

Well: 34/10-4
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-4 was drilled in the Delta closure in the north-eastern part of block 34/10 in the northern North Sea. The Delta structure consists of several separate fault blocks and 34/10-4 targeted one of these. It was the third well drilled in the Delta closure. Two other separate fault blocks had previously proved oil bearing by well 34/10-1 located to the south, and well 34/10-3 located about 2 km north-west. The primary objective of well 34/10-4 was to test sandstones of Middle Jurassic age. Secondary objectives were sandstones of Early Jurassic age.
                


Operations and results


Well 34/10-4 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Ross Rig on 12 August 1979 and drilled to TD at 2600 m in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. No specific problems were encountered in the operations. The well was drilled with sea water and gel slugs down to 641 m and with sea water, gel, lignite and lignosulphonate in various proportions from 641 m to TD.


A minor hydrocarbon-bearing interval was encountered in the Eocene from 1290 to 1307 m but the type of hydrocarbons could not be determined. The net Eocene "pay" was 8.25 m with average porosity of 34.4% and average water saturation of 38.5%. The main target Brent Group sandstones were encountered at 1816 m and were found oil bearing down to claystone at 1912 m. It contained 81 m of net pay with an average porosity of 33.7% and an average water saturation of 12.5%. The Statfjord Formation (2350 - 2481 m) was water bearing with 61 m of net sand with an average porosity of 23.3%.
                


The first show was recorded on a well site sample from 1280 m, just above the Eocene pay. It was described with "dead oil, dull fluorescence". Otherwise, oil shows with fluorescence, cut and oil stains were recorded in limestones, claystones, siltstones and marl from 1380 m and more or less continuously down to 1755 m.


Five cores were recovered in the interval from 1826 to 1909 m in the Rannoch and Broom formations of the Brent Group and one core from 2350.5 to 2364.5 m in the Eirikson and Raude members of the Statfjord Formation. An RFT fluid sample was taken at 1827.5 m


The well was permanently abandoned on 15 October 1979 as an oil appraisal well.


Testing




Two drill stem tests were run in the Rannoch Formation.


DST 1A tested the interval 1880 to 1885 m. The well produced 280 Sm3 oil and 24300 Sm3 gas /day through a 20/64" choke. The GOR was 87 Sm3/Sm3 and the oil gravity was 29deg API. The bottom hole maximum temperature was 72.4 deg C.


DST 2 tested the interval 1824 to 1826 m. The well produced 810 Sm3 oil and 67400 Sm3 gas/day through two parallel chokes (20/64" + 32/64"). The GOR was 83 Sm3/Sm3 and the oil gravity was 29deg API. The bottom hole maximum temperature was 71.5 deg C.


No water was produced in the DST's.

Well: 34/10-5
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-5 was drilled in the western part of the Delta Closure in Block 34/10 in the Northern North Sea. The primary objective of well 34/10-5 was sandstones of Middle Jurassic age. Secondary objectives were sandstones of Early Jurassic age.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/10-5 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Ross Rig on 18 October 1979 and drilled to TD at 2780 m in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. Apart from lost circulation problems in the 12 1/4" section the drilling itself went quite smoothly. However, almost 21 days were lost due to bad weather conditions. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 518 m, with gel/lignosulphonate from 518 to 1775 m, with gel/lignite/lignosulphonate from 1775 m to 2210 m, and with gel/lignosulphonate from 2210 m to TD.


The Brent Group was encountered at 1896 m and was oil bearing down to the OWC at ca 1972 m. Test results indicated the same fluid system as in the previous wells drilled on the structure.


Oil shows were recorded from 1250 m and downwards more or less continuously on claystone, limestone and siltstone to top Brent level. No shows were recorded below OWC.


Four cores were recovered in the interval from 1917 to 1974.7 m. One RFT fluid sample from the Brent Group recovered ca 0.5 l oil and 1 l of mud filtrate.


The well was permanently abandoned on 2 January 1980 as an oil appraisal well.


Testing




The Tarbert Formation was tested from perforations in the interval 1925 -1927 m. The zone produced ca 724 Sm3 oil and 59400 Sm3 gas /day. No water was produced. The GOR was 82 Sm3/Sm3 and the oil gravity was 29 deg API. The bottom hole maximum temperature was 74.5 deg C, measured at 1907 m.

Well: 34/10-6
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-6 was drilled on the northern part of the Delta structure in block 34/10 in the northern North Sea. It was the fifth well drilled on the structure. All four foregoing wells had tested oil in the Brent Group. The primary objective was to test Middle Jurassic Brent Group. Secondary objectives were sandstones of Early Jurassic age.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/10-6 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Borgny Dolphin on 13 November 1979 and drilled to TD at 2362 m. A total of 14.6% of the rig time was lost due to waiting on weather. The other main causes of downtime was technical failure during cementing of the 9 5/8" casing, followed by two squeeze jobs, repair of subsea equipment and lost circulation. The lost circulation was experienced on several occasions when drilling the 8 1/2" hole. The main reason for this was that the 9 5/8" casing (and 13 3/8" casing) were set too high, causing low formation integrity at the casing shoes. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 308 m and with seawater/polymer from 308 m to TD.


The Brent Group sandstones were encountered at 2075 m, about 100 m below the OWC established in the previous wells drilled on the Delta structure. The Brent Group was 215 m thick with 145 m net of good reservoir sands (average porosity = 27.8 %). The Brent Group was water bearing. Oil shows were seen from 1580 m to 1632 m in the Balder Formation, and from 1710 m to 1812 m in the Lista Formation and top Shetland Group, otherwise no evidence of hydrocarbons was seen in the well.


No conventional cores were cut. The RFT tool was run for pressure points, but no wire line fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 22 January 1980 as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/10-7
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-7 was drilled on the eastern segment of the Gullfaks Field. The primary objective was to test sandstones of Middle Jurassic age. Secondary objective was sandstones of Early Jurassic age: the Cook and the Statfjord Formations.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/10 7 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Ross Rig on 7 January 1980 and drilled to TD at 2550 m in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. Two major problems were encountered during drilling. The first one concerned water sensitive clays which caused difficulties when underreaming the hole for both the 16" liner and the 13 3/8" casing. The second problem was the leak off test below the 9 5/8" casing shoe. While circulating prior the second leak off test the formation broke down. Four cement squeezes were required before a proper formation test was obtained. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 845 m and with gel/lignosulphonate mud from 845 m to TD.


Weak to good oil shows were recorded from 1320 m in the lower Hordaland Group and downwards, mostly in limestone. Strong shows with live oil in the mud were recorded between 1380 and 1415 m. Oil shows of variable strength continued all the way down through the Hordaland, Rogaland and Shetland Groups. The Shetland Group was found resting directly on the Early Jurassic Cook Formation sandstone at 1810 m. Oil was found in sandstones of the Cook and Statfjord Formations. No oil/water contact was observed in the Cook Formation. In the Statfjord Formation an oil water contact was found at 2066 m.
                


A total 53.2 m core (67% recovery) was recovered in 5 cores in the interval from 1813 m to 1892 m. A sixth core was taken with 100% recovery from 1942 to 1949 m. RFT fluid samples were taken at 1821 m in the Cook Formation and at 2055 m in the Statfjord Formation.


The well was suspended on 23 March 1980 as an oil appraisal well.


Testing




One drill stem test was performed from perforation at 1858 - 1856 m in the Cook Formation. The test produced 471 Sm3 oil and 59200 Sm3 gas /day through a 40/64" choke. The GOR was 126 Sm3/Sm3, the oil density was 0.832 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was 0.68 (air = 1) with 0.5% CO2. The maximum temperature at perforation depth was 77.7 deg C.

Well: 34/10-8
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-8 was drilled on the southern part of the Gullfaks Field. The primary objective was to test sandstones of Middle Jurassic age. Secondary objectives were sandstones in the Early Jurassic.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/10-8 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Saga on 8 March and drilled to TD at 2214 m in the Early Jurassic Cook Formation. Some problems with lost circulation was encountered when circulating prior to cementing the 13 3/8" casing. Also the drill string became stuck during plug back operations at 2037 m and 9 days were lost when fishing for it. The well was drilled with Gel/spud mud down to 875 m and with gel/lignosulphonate from 875 m to TD.


The Middle Jurassic Brent Group sandstones came in with Tarbert Formation on top at 1821 m and the Ness Formation at 1853 m. The Tarbert and Ness formations were hydrocarbon-bearing with a 151 m gross pay zone from1821 to 1972 m. The Early Jurassic sandstones of the Cook Formation were water saturated. Above the reservoir good oil shows were recorded on limestone from 1712 to 1745 m and on limestone/mudstone/siltstone from 1665 to 1705 m. Otherwise traces of oil shows were recorded above the reservoir up to a depth of 1220 m. No shows were recorded below the oil bearing reservoir.


A total of 13 cores were taken from 1823 to 1976 m, with a total recovery of 140 m. The RFT tool was run in the Brent sand and good data was obtained from 1826 to 2006 m. Fifteen out of seventeen tests were successful. In the Ness zone a fluid sample was taken at 1950 m.


The well was permanently abandoned on 25 May 1980 as an oil appraisal well.


Testing




The well was perforated and tested in the interval 1869 to 1873 m in the Brent Group, Ness Formation. The test produced 498 Sm3 oil and 33900 Sm3 gas /day. The GOR was 68 Sm3/Sm3, the oil gravity was 29.5 deg API, and the gas gravity was 0.622 (air = 1). After the flow test an injection test was performed, indicating a fracture pressure of ca 5500 psig.

Well: 34/10-9
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-9 was drilled on the central part of the Gullfaks Field. The primary objective was to test sandstones of the Early Jurassic Cook Formation. Originally the well was planned to be drilled to a total depth of 2000 m. Results from the well required further drilling into sandstones of the Statfjord Formation.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/10-9 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Ross Rig on 24 March 1980 and drilled to TD at 2200 m in the Early Jurassic Burton Formation. As in other wells drilled in the area the pore pressure was close to the formation integrity in the pressure transition zone. Lost circulation combined with high gas readings, was experienced on several occasions in this zone between ca 1730 and 1760 m. Apart from that, the drilling was carried out without any specific problems. The well was drilled with seawater and high viscosity slugs down to 845 m, and with a gel/lignosulphonate mud system from 845 m to TD. From the well site sample description diesel was added to the mud in the interval 1260 to 1350 m.


The Brent Group, Ness formation was encountered at 1833 m, directly underlying the Late Cretaceous Kyrre Formation. The Brent Group was hydrocarbon bearing down to base Rannoch Formation at 1945 m with ca 97 m net hydrocarbon bearing sands. The Cook Formation was hydrocarbon bearing with an oil/water contact at 2118 m. First trace of oil shows, fluorescence, was seen at 1220 m. Weak shows on claystone and limestone were recorded from this depth to 1500 m. Stronger oil shows with "oil streaks over shaker" and oil-smell were recorded from 1690 m to 1720 m in the Lista Formation.
                


Four cores were cut in the well. Core 1 was cut from 1850 to 1868 m in the Etive Formation, while cores 2 to 4 were cut from 2089 m to 2130 m in the Cook Formation. The Formation interval tester (FIT) was run in the well for fluid sampling. One sample was recovered from the Brent formation at 1840 m. The sample contained hydrocarbons. The other sample was taken in the Cook Formation at 2132 m. This sample contained water.


The well was suspended on 9 May 1980 for further drilling and testing in a later re-entry. It is classified as an oil appraisal well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/10-11
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-11 was drilled on the Gullfaks Delta structure in the North Sea. The primary objective of the well was to test sandstones of Middle Jurassic age. Secondary objectives were sandstones of Lower Jurassic age.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/10-11 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Ross Rig on 23 October 1980 and drilled to TD at 2155 m in Late Triassic sediments of the Lunde Formation. Bad weather caused 511 hrs lost time (15.7% of total rig time). Significant lost time (509 hrs) was caused also by malfunction and repairs of the BOP. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 463 m, with gel/lignosulphonate/seawater mud from 463 m to 1100 m, with Gypsum/lignosulphonate/sweater mud from 1100 m to 1720 m, and with gel/lignosulphonate/seawater mud from 1720 m to TD.
                


First oil shows were recorded from 1090 m to 1200 m, intermittent weak shows were seen from 1420 to 1495, and more or less continuous oil shows were recorded on limestone from 1660 m to top reservoir at 1868 m. The well proved oil in sandstones from top of the Early Jurassic Amundsen Formation at 1868 down to the OWC at 2038 m in Late Triassic sediments of the Raude Formation. Below 2038 m shows were recorded down to TD.


Six cores were cut in the interval 1870 m to 1926.5 m in the Amundsen and Nansen formations. Two FIT fluid samplings were attempted. FIT 1 at 2081 m recovered 3 litres 35 °API oil and 7 litres of mud filtrate in the 2 3/4 gallon chamber. The FIT 2 at 2051 m did not recover any fluids.
                


The well was permanently abandoned on 5 march 1981 as a as an oil appraisal well on the Gullfaks field.


Testing




Two drill stem tests were conducted in the Statfjord Group.


DST1 tested the interval 2018 to 2028 m in the Raude Formation. It produced 399 Sm3 oil and 60880 Sm3 gas /day through a 24/64” choke. GOR was 153 Sm3/Sm3, oil gravity was 36.5°API, and gas gravity was 0.647 (air = 1). The bottom hole temperature in the test was 79.9°C.


DST2 tested the interval 1891 to 1896 m in the Nansen Formation. It produced 389 Sm3 oil and 64560 Sm3 gas /day through a 24/64” choke. GOR was 166 Sm3/Sm3, oil gravity was 36.5°API, and gas gravity was 0.656 (air = 1). The bottom hole temperature in the test was 75.6°C.

Well: 34/10-12
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-12 was drilled on Tampen Spur in the North Sea close to the western side of the Gullfaks Fault Block. The primary objective of the well was to test sandstones of Middle Jurassic age. Secondary objectives were sandstones of Early Jurassic age.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/10-12 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Neptuno Nordraug on 16 July 1981 and drilled to TD at 2800 m in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Group. The well was drilled with seawater and prehydrated Gel pills down to 298 m and with gel/lignosulphonate mud from 298 m to TD.


The sandstones of both Middle and Early Jurassic age were water saturated. Shows were recorded on cuttings from claystones, limestone and occasional thin sandstones from 1260 m in the Hordaland Group to 1657 m in the Balder Formation. The Jurassic had only trace fluorescence in sandstone cuttings at 2094 to 2110 m in the Ness Formation, otherwise no trace of hydrocarbons were seen.


One core was cut from 2037 m to 2042.7 m in the Ness Formation. No wire line fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 12 September as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 34/10-13
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-13 was drilled on a horst block in the eastern part of the Gullfaks Fault Block. The primary objective of the well was to test the sandstone of Early Jurassic age (Statfjord formation). The Secondary objective was Carnian sandstone.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/10-13 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Saga on 24 August 1981 and drilled to TD at 3392 m, 76 m into the Carnian sandstone. At 1725 m, the well started to flow. The influx was circulated out with 1.69 s.g. mud. A total of 21.5 days were lost due to a strike after the drilling of the 6" section had been initiated. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 300 m, with seawater gel from 300 m to 893 m, and with gel/lignosulphonate mud from 893 m to TD. The RFT tool stuck at 2882 m during sampling. The tool was left in the hole and the well was plugged back and tested.
                


First oil shows, typically cut and/or fluorescence on claystone and limestone cuttings, was recorded at 1350 m in the Hordaland Group. The shows were described more or less continuous down to top Statfjord reservoir at 1924 m. When drilling mudstones, limestone and marl in the Lista Formation from 1656 to 1701 m there was oil in the mud. Oil was found from top Statfjord Group at 1924 m and down to at least 2114 m in the Hegre Group where oil was tested on DST. No oil/water contact could be established in the Statfjord sandstone and pressure measurements in the Hegre Group were inconclusive. Shows were recorded on sandstones down to 2450 m.  From petrophysical analyses the Statfjord Group had 70 m net pay with 27% average porosity and 24% average water saturation. The Hegre Group reservoir had 16.5 m net pay with average 27.8% porosity and 56% average water saturation. The Carnian sand was encountered at 3316 m. It was waterbearing without shows.


Sixteen cores were cut in the well. Fifteen cores were cut in succession from 1931 m to 2087 m in the Amundsen Formation and Statfjord Group and recovered a total of 150.8 m core (87% total recovery). The last core was cut from 3373.5 m to 3391.5 m in the Carnian sandstone with 92% recovery. RFT fluid samples were taken at 1936.5 m (oil and gas), 1940 m (oil and gas) and 2111 m (oil and gas).


The well was permanently abandoned on 5 January 1982 as an oil appraisal well on the Gullfaks Field.


Testing




Two drill stem tests were performed.


DST 1 tested the interval 2107 m to 2114 m in the Hegre Group. The test produced 440 Sm3 oil/day through a 32/64” choke. The GOR was 82.1 Sm3/Sm3 and the oil gravity was 31 °API. The temperature measured at gauge depth was 84 °C.
                


DST2 tested the interval 2003 to 2009 m in the Statfjord Group. The test produced 835 Sm3 oil/day through a 32/64” choke. The GOR was 92.5 Sm3/Sm3 and the oil gravity was 40.1 °API. Solution gas had a gravity of 0.82 (air = 1). The temperature measured at gauge depth was 79.8 °C.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 34/10-14
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-14 was drilled on a horst block in the north-eastern part of the Gullfaks field. The objectives of the well were to prove the structural position of the middle- and early Jurassic sandstones and to establish the oil-water contact in the Brent Group in this part of the field.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/10-14 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Ross Rig on 24 December 1981 and drilled to TD at 2647 m in the Triassic Hegre Group. Significant downtime (17% of total rig time) was caused by the combined effect of bad weather and the need to pull the BOP three times to detect leaks. The well was drilled with gel/lignosulphonate/seawater mud all through.


Weak shows on limestone and claystone cuttings were recorded intermittently from 1506 m in the Hordaland down to top Shetland Group at 1729 m. Sandstones of the Ness Formation were oil-bearing from 1908 m to the oil-water contact, indicated by pressure measurements and logs to be at 1972 m. This corresponds to the OWC found in the wells 34/10-3, 5 and 8. Shows on cores continued down to 2002 m.


Ten cores were recovered, nine in the interval from 1889 to 2047m KB and one core from 2210 to 2228 KB. RFT fluid sampling was performed at 1917.5 m and 1961.5 m but the fluids recovered were not representative for the reservoir fluid.
                


The well was permanently abandoned on 19 March 1982 as an oil appraisal well.


Testing




One drill stem test was performed in the interval 1933.5 m to 1937.5 m in the Ness Formation. The test produced 713 Sm3 oil/day through a 34/64” choke. The GOR was 67 Sm3/Sm3, separator oil gravity was 29.4 °API, and gas gravity was 0.67 (air = 1). The maximum temperature at gauge depth was 75 °C.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 34/10-15
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10 15 was drilled as a wildcat on a horst block in the south-eastern part of the Gullfaks Field. The primary purpose of the well was to test hydrocarbon accumulations in the Jurassic and Brent sands. Secondary objectives were the Early Jurassic Statfjord sands and to test shallow gas accumulations in Pliocene sands.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/10-15 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Neptuno Nordraug on 16 October 1982 and drilled to TD at 2400 m in Late Triassic sediments in the Statfjord Group. A 12 1/4” pilot hole was drilled from 250 m to 950 m to check for shallow gas. The well was situated ca 90 m south of the location for the well 34/10-10, which was abandoned due to gas flow from a gas filled sand at 428 m. The same sandlense was penetrated in the well 34/10-15 from 444-447 m. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 250 m and with gel/seawater/lignosulphonate mud from 250 m to TD.


Weak shows on cuttings, mostly on limestone, were recorded intermittently from 1220 m in the Hordaland Group to 1630 m in the Lista Formation. The Brent Group sands were not encountered. Late Triassic Statfjord Group sands were found water wet without shows. The Cook Formation sands contained residual oil.
                


Ten cores were cut. Cores 1 to 5 were cut from 1870 m to 1945 m in the Cook Formation with recoveries varying from 34% to 75%. Cores 6, 7, and 8 were cut from 2170 m to 2213 m in the Amundsen Formation with recoveries varying from 87% to 93%. Cores 9 and 10 were cut from 2301 m to 2323 m in the Statfjord Group with 90% and 85% recoveries, respectively. An RFT fluid sample was taken at 1875.5 m in the Cook Formation residual oil zone. The sample contained brown water and smelled oil.


The well was permanently abandoned on 12 December 1982 as a dry well with shows.


Testing




A shallow gas test was planned from the interval 444 m to 447 m. The purpose of this test was to gather information about whether the gas would flow to surface and if the sandlense could be drained. The test was cancelled due to problems in cutting the 13 3/8" casing deep enough to allow for perforations in the 20" casing in the test interval.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 34/10-16
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-16 was drilled on the Gullfaks Sør structure, 8 km south of the Gullfaks Field. The purpose of this well was to investigate a fault block, en echelon to the first fault block tested by well 34/10-2, for possible extension of hydrocarbon accumulation. The principal drilling objective was sandstones of the Brent Group. Secondary objectives were the Cook and Statfjord sands, of which the Statfjord sand proved the presence of oil in well 34/10-2.
                


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/10-16 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Nordraug on 14 December 1982 and drilled to TD at 4042 m (4027 m TVD) in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. Excessive time were lost due to waiting on weather, hole problems, logging problems and other technical problems. These problems consumed a total of 1080 hours or 45 days downtime. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 225 m, with gel/seawater from 225 m to 617 m, and with lignosulphonate CMC/gel mud from 617 m to TD.


The Brent Group came in at 3171 m and contained both oil and gas with the gas/oil contact at ca 3350 m and the oil/water contact at ca 3422 m, according to the logs. The gas net pay was estimated to 84 m with average porosity 18.2% and average water saturation 22.5%. The oil net pay was estimated to 29.5 m with average porosity 16.5% and average water saturation 38.9%. No hydrocarbons were encountered in the Cook and Statfjord Formations. No oil shows were recorded outside of the Brent Group.
                


A total of 23 cores were cut, 22 of these covering nearly all of the Brent Group and the last one covering a sandstone in the upper Statfjord Formation. The RFT tool was run for fluid samples. Segregated RFT samples were recovered from 3356 m (oil) and 3345 m (condensate). No pressure points were acquired due to bad hole conditions.
                


The well was temporary plugged 11 April 1983 and later re entered for drill stem testing. It is classified as an oil appraisal well


Testing




No drill stem test was performed
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 34/10-17
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-17 was the first well drilled on the Beta structure in the SE segment of block 34/10, south-west of the Alpha-structure, which contained the Gullfaks Sør Field. The primary objective of the well was to evaluate possible hydrocarbon accumulations in the Middle Jurassic Brent sandstones. The secondary objectives were the Early Jurassic Dunlin and Statfjord sandstones.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/10-17 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Bergen on 22 February 1983 and drilled to TD at 3466 m in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation. The well was drilled down to 2687 m without special drilling problems. At 2687 m a heavy flow was observed after a drilling break. The well was shut in, and due to a plugged cement hose and kill line failsafe valve, about 200 hours were used to circulate out the influx, stabilize, clean up and condition the hole. Further technical failure and tight hole caused extensive time logging the 6" section, and the logging programme was reduced. The well was drilled with Seawater/gel spud mud down to 668 m and with seawater/gel/Lignosulphonate mud from 668 m to TD.


The Brent Group was encountered at 2685 m with hydrocarbon bearing sandstones in the Tarbert and Ness Formations. FMT pressures indicated a gas/oil contact at ca 2862 m, and an oil/water contact at ca 2914 m in the lower part of the Ness Formation. The logs indicated a total oil and gas net pay of 122.5 m with average porosity 22.5% and average water saturation 27%. Also the underlying water bearing Etive and Rannoch Formations of the Brent Group had good reservoir quality sandstones. The Dunlin and Statfjord sandstones were water bearing. Shows were recorded on cores down to 2947.5 m in the Rannoch Formation, and a geochemical core extract from 2923 m showed a chromatographic fingerprint no different from core extracts taken in the oil-zone. Otherwise no significant oil shows were seen in the well outside of the oil-bearing reservoir.


A total of 16 cores were cut continuously through the Brent reservoir section down to ca middle of the Rannoch Formation. The core-log depth match was generally good, but with minor deviations due to expansion of the cores after they were landed. The FMT tool was run for pressure samples in the Brent and Dunlin Group and in the Statfjord Formation. Segregated fluid samples were taken in the Brent Group at 2697 m (gas and condensate) and at 2889 m (oil).


The well was permanently abandoned on 8 July 1983 as an oil and gas discovery.


Testing




The well was tested from four zones in the Brent sand. One DST produced water, the other produced hydrocarbons.


DST 1 tested the interval 2934 to 2944 m and produced only water at a rate of 1024 Sm3/day through a 40/64" choke in the main flow. Maximum down hole temperature recorded in the test was 108.1 deg C.


DST 2 tested the interval 2880 to 2890 m and produced 545 Sm3 oil and 134000 Sm3 gas/day through a 28/64" choke in the main flow. The GOR was 246 Sm3/Sm3, the oil density was 0.85 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was 0.74 (air = 1) with ca 1% CO2 and 1 ppm H2S. Maximum temperature recorded in the test was 106.0 deg C.


DST 3 tested the interval 2835 to 2845 m and produced 452 Sm3 condensate and 364000 Sm3 gas/day through a 32/64" choke in the third flow period. The GCR was 805 Sm3/Sm3, the condensate density was 0.78 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was 0.72 (air = 1) with trace CO2 and no detectable H2S. A somewhat higher oil rate and lower GOR was recorded on a 48/64" choke in the second flow period. Maximum temperature recorded in the test was 104.3 deg C.


DST 4 tested multiple intervals from 2754 to 2790.5 m and produced 320 Sm3 condensate and 428000 Sm3 gas/day through a 32/64" choke in the third flow. The GCR was 1338 Sm3/Sm3, the condensate density was 0.76 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was 0.71 (air = 1) with ca 1% CO2 and 0.6 ppm H2S. Maximum temperature recorded in the test was 101.2 deg C.

General


Well 34/10-18 is located in the Tampen Spur area, south of the Vigdis Field and west-north-west of the Gullfaks Field. The primary objective was the Brent Group sandstones of Middle Jurassic age. Secondary objectives were Early Jurassic Cook and Statfjord Formation sandstones.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/10-18 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Ross Isle on 17 July 1983. A 12 1/4" pilot hole was drilled from the 30" casing shoe to 765 m to check for shallow gas. No shallow gas was seen, but lost circulation occurred in shallow sand lenses when the pilot was underreamed to 26". A 17 1/2" hole was drilled and logged to 2024 m. Two joints of 13 3/8" casing were dropped in the hole. The hole was cemented back to 1882 m and sidetracked from 1900 m and drilled without significant problems to TD at 3025 m in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 765 m and with gel/Lignosulphonate mud from 765 m to TD.
                


No live oil was seen in the well, but a 3.5 m unproductive oil-zone was encountered in a, sandy/marly and cemented limestone at the base of a very thin Cromer Knoll sequence (Mime Formation). The average porosity was 24.3% and the average water saturation was 53.4%, but due to tight formation the RFT was not able to obtain any pressure points in this zone. The permeability range was 0.1 to 1 mD. Only residual hydrocarbons were encountered in the Brent sandstones.


Here, t
he logs indicated an average water saturation of 95% and an average porosity of 24.2% in the net sand.


The RFT plot suggested a water gradient of 1.00 g/cc in the Brent Group. Weak oil shows typically described as "hydrocarbon fluorescence in sandy tuffaceous material" were recorded in the Balder Formation.


Three cores were cut in the well. Core 1 was cut in the Early Cretaceous and into the Upper Jurassic and core 2 in the Late Jurassic Heather Formation. Core 3 was cut in the Middle Jurassic Tarbert Formation. No wire line fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 30 August 1983 as a well with shows.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/10-19
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-19 was drilled to investigate the southern section of the Gullfaks Phase II area. The primary objective was to penetrate the Cook sandstone above the oil water contact at 2118 m seen in well 34/10-9, and to improve the understanding of the reserve distribution in this part of the Gullfaks field. Secondary objective was the Statfjord sandstone.
                


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/10-19 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Ross Isle on 5 October 1983 and drilled to TD at 2218 m in the Triassic Hegre Formation. Shallow gas was encountered in a sand at 332 to 338 m. A 16" liner was required to stop gas flow between 20" and 30" casings. Several drilling breaks occurred in the 12 1/4" hole and lost circulation occurred in the 8 1/2" hole. The well was drilled with gel/seawater down to 8978 m, with gel/seawater/hi-vis pills from 978 m to 1494 m, and with gel/lignosulphonate/lignite mud from 1494 m to TD.


The upper sandstone part of the Cook formation (unit C3 and C2) was missing missing due to faulting and erosion. The lower Cook C1 unit was penetrated at 1779 m. This unit consists of dominantly claystones and it was water bearing. The sandstones of the Statfjord Formation were water bearing. Trace shows were recorded in the Hordaland Group on claystones from 960 m to 120 m and on claystone and on limestone from 1340 m to 1470 m. Trace to fair shows on siltstone, claystone and minor sandstones were recorded intermittently below 1470 m and down to 1861 m. No trace of hydrocarbons was seen below this depth.


Three cores were cut; one in the interval from 1763 in the Cromer Knoll Group to 1781.3 m in the Cook Formation, and two in the interval 1847 to 1874.8 m in the Jurassic Dunlin Group. No wire line fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 6 December 1983 as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/10-20
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-20 was the first well drilled on the Gamma structure south of Gullfaks Sør in the northern North Sea. The primary objective was the Middle Jurassic Brent Group. Secondary objectives were Early Cretaceous sandstones, the Cook Formation and the Statfjord Group.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/10-20 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Ross Isle on 23 December 1983 and drilled to TD at 3747 m in the Early Cretaceous Cromer Knoll Group. The well was plugged back and abandoned without reaching the targets. Engineering difficulties associated with high fluid pressure and low formation integrity was the reason why the well had to be abandoned. It was drilled with gel/seawater down to 1053 m, with KCl/polymer mud from 1053 m to 2990 m, and with lignosulphonate mud from 2990 m to TD.
                


The well was dry. Zones with weak shows, mostly on claystone cuttings, were recorded from 1860 m to 2050 m in the Rogaland Group.
                


No cores were cut and no wire line fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 23 April 1984 as a junk well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 34/10-21
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-21 was the third well drilled on the Gullfaks South structure in the Tampen Spur area in the northern North Sea. The objective was to test for possible hydrocarbon accumulations and for a possible extension of reserves in the Gullfaks South field. Targets included the Brent, Cook and Statfjord Sandstones and possible sand accumulations in the Early Cretaceous.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/10-21 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Dyvi Delta on 26 July 1984 and drilled to TD at 4005 m in Late Triassic sediments of the Raude Formation. The well was drilled with gel/seawater down to 615 m, with gypsum/CMC/lignosulphonate from 615 m 3196 m, and with gel/lignosulphonate from 3196 m to TD.


No sandstones were encountered in the Early Cretaceous. Hydrocarbon bearing Brent sandstone was encountered at 3287 m, with the hydrocarbon/water contact established at 3333 m+/-3 m. No hydrocarbons were identified in the Cook sandstones. The logs indicated hydrocarbons in the Statfjord Group, but drill stem test gave no flow from these sandstones. No shows were described above the Tarbert reservoir. Below the OWC, shows on sandstone were described down to 3359 m.


Six cores were cut; four from 3289 m to 3383 in the Brent Group and two from 3970 m to 3985.5 in the Raude Formation. Core recoveries were from 90 % to 100 %. RFT fluid samples were taken in the Brent Group oil zone at 3298.5 m, 3317.3 m, and 3325.0 m.


The well was permanently abandoned on 22 October 1984 as a gas appraisal well.


Testing




Two drill stem tests were performed.
                


DST 1 tested the interval 3905.2 m to 3922.2 m in the Statfjord Group. This test gave no flow.


DST 2 tested the interval 3290.7 - 3312.7 m in the Tarbert Formation. This test produced 130 Sm3 condensate and 837800 Sm3 gas /day through a 14.29 mm choke. The GOR was 6424 SM3/Sm3, the condensate density was 0.80 g/cm3, the gas gravity was 0.65 (air=1). The downhole temperature reading in the test was 119.3 °C.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 34/10-23
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-23 was drilled on the Gullfaks Gamma structure, south-southeast of the Gullfaks Sør Field in the Northern North Sea. The objectives were to prove a significant hydrocarbon accumulation, with the Brent Group as the primary target and the Early Jurassic as secondary target. The first well on the structure, well 34/10-20, had the same targets as 34/10-23, but was terminated in the Early Cretaceous due to technical problems.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/10-23 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Dyvi Delta on 6 May 1985 and drilled to TD at 4764 m into Sinemurian /possibly Rhaetian age sediments of the Statfjord Formation. The well took 28 days more than prognosed to drill. The main part of the extra time came in the 8 1/2" section, where among many other things, the BOP stack was pulled for inspection and repairs. A flow occurred at 4080 m just above top Brent Group, and approximately three days were used to bring the well under control. At 4409 m (4406.5 m TVD RKB) the deviation exceeded 5 deg. The last survey, at 4514 m (4510.8 m TVD RKB) m showed 9.1 deg deviation. If this deviation is extrapolated the vertical depth at TD is 4756.2, ca 8 m short of measured depth. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 1252 m, with gypsum/lignosulphonate mud from 1252 to 3118 m, and with gypsum/lignosulphonate/lignite mud from 3118 m to 4525 m. At 4509 m the pipe stuck, and imco-spot/pipelax pills with 3% diesel were placed to free it. The final section from 4525 m to TD was drilled with a gel/lignosulphonate/lignite/Anco Resin mud system.
                


The pore pressure increased through the entire Cretaceous section and reached a maximum of 1.96 g/cc at the top of the Brent Group. Gas bearing Brent sandstone was encountered at 4083 m, approximately 100 m deeper than prognosed. A gas-water contact established at 4120 m. Analyses of the gas and the DST liquids showed a condensate character with significant contents of heavier components up to C35, including biomarkers.


Oil shows were recorded in sandstones in the Lista Formation from 2020 to 2050 m, and in the Kyrre Formation around 2954 m. Weak shows on limestone was recorded in the Svarte Formation from 3640 to 3714 m. Intermittent fluorescence was recorded on sandstones on cores, sidewall cores and cuttings below the hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir down to TD. Some of these could be due to pipe-freeing agents added at 4509 m.


Eleven cores were cut from 4082 m to 4308 m in the Tarbert, Ness, Etive, and Rannoch formations with an average recovery close to 100%. RFT wire line fluid samples were taken at 4084 m, 4176 m, 4718.5 m, and 4718.6 m.


The well was permanently abandoned on 13 October 1985 as a gas/condensate discovery.


Testing




One drill stem test, DST1, was performed in the interval 4085 - 4095 m. The test produced 1720000 Sm3 gas, 150 Sm3 oil, and 15 m3 water per day through a 22.2 mm choke. The initial reservoir pressure was 785.3 bar and the draw-down was 41 bar. The GOR was 11500 Sm3/Sm3. The DST temperature was 150 deg C.

Well: 34/10-28
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-28 was drilled on the fourth well drilled on Gullfaks South. It was drilled in the north-eastern part of the Alpha structure, and the primary objectives were to test for hydrocarbons in the Middle Jurassic Brent Group and the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation. The Early Jurassic Cook Formation, water bearing in the other wells on the Gullfaks South, was a secondary objective.
                


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/10-28 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Dyvi Stena on 2 January 1986. When running the BOP, after having set the 20" casing, the guide posts were damaged and the well was abandoned with TD at 528 m in Pliocene sediments in the Nordland Group. The well was drilled with water based mud.


Top Pliocene was encountered at 290 m. Shallow gas was found in a sand at 332 - 339 m. Otherwise the drilled section contained clay and only minor sand stringers.


No cores were cut and no fluid samples were taken. Only MWD logs were run. Cuttings samples were taken every 10 m from 260 m to TD.
                


The well was permanently abandoned on 16 January 1986.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 34/10-30
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-30 was the fifth well drilled on Gullfaks Sør. The well was the "continuation" of the junked well 34/10-28, which was plugged and abandoned at 528 m. Well 34/10-30 was drilled on the Alpha structure, and designed to test for hydrocarbon accumulations in the North East part of the structure. The main objectives were the Brent and Statfjord sandstones. The Lower Jurassic Cook sandstone, which had been water bearing in the other Gullfaks Sør wells, was considered a secondary objective, as was the penetration of the oil/water contact. Prognosed depth was 3435 m.


Operations


Appraisal well 34/10-30 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Dyvi Stena on 16 January 1986 and drilled to TD at 3785 m in the Triassic Lunde Formation. Drilling proceeded without significant problems, but 20" casing was set early due to shallow gas in the interval 332-340 m. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 232 m, with PAC/polymer mud from 232 m to 325 m, with gypsum / PAC mud from 325 m to 1898 m, with gypsum/PAC/"Borewell" mud from 1898 m to 2845 m, and with Lignite/"Borewell" mud from 2845 m to TD.
                


A four-meter thick Brent sandstone was encountered at 2941 m. The sandstone showed a milky white to pale yellow fluorescence with a slow white streaming cut and a C1/C2 mud gas ratio that indicate a gas bearing formation. The Cook Formation was dry. The top of the Statfjord Formation was at 3120 m, approximately 100 m higher than prognosed. The formation was all filled with oil and gas and had a gas-oil contact at 3251.6 m. The Lunde Formation was reached at 3375 m. The formation was oil bearing with no defined oil-water contact. The oil/water contact was expected at 3395 m. This was not the case and drilling of a 6" section thus commenced past the prognosed depth. The oil water contact was difficult to define, but there is reason to believe it to be at approximately 3712 m. Twenty-two cores were cut in the well, 9 in the Lunde Formation, 12 in the Statfjord Formation, and one in the Dunlin Group. One segregated RFT sample was collected in the Lunde Formation at 3554.0 m. The bottom part of the well was plugged back into the 7" liner without permission from NPD. The well was tested and subsequently plugged and abandoned on 12 may 1986 as an oil and gas appraisal well.


Testing


Three drill stem tests were performed. DST No 1 (3460 m to 3473 m) in the Lunde Formation flowed 418 Sm3 oil /d with a GOR of 146 Sm3/Sm3 through a 12.7 mm choke, DST No 2 (3296 m to 3317 m) in the oil zone in the Statfjord Formation flowed 1161 Sm3 oil /d with a GOR of 102 Sm3/Sm3 through a 17.5 mm choke, while DST No 3 (3125 m to 3155 m) in the gas zone in the Statfjord Formation flowed 352 Sm3 oil/d and 1151000 Sm3 gas/d (GOR = 3270 Sm3/Sm3) through a 17.5 mm choke.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 34/10-32
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-32 was the fifth well on the Gullfaks South structure. The main objective was to confirm hydrocarbons in the southern part of the structure, and to get data for update of the structural and geological model of the area. The main target was the Statfjord Formation, where the oil-water contact was expected at 3360 m. Secondary targets were Brent Group sandstones and the Lunde Formation.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/10-32 was spudded 9 April 1987 by Smedvig semi-submersible installation West Vision and drilled to TD at 3753 m in the Triassic Lunde Formation. Shallow gas was found in the neighbouring hole, and it was decided to set the 20" casing early. There was one meter of shallow gas in this hole as well, but no problems occurred due to this. At setting depth of 13 3/8" casing at 1982 m in the Lista Formation the casing stuck at approximately 1000 m. After several days of fishing 700 m casing was retrieved, while 300 m dropped to the bottom of the hole. The well was sidetracked with kick-off point at 1323 m and further drilling proceeded without significant problems. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 350 m, with gypsum/polymer mud from 350 m to 2940 m, and with lignosulphonate/lignite mud from 2940 m to TD.


The stratigraphy came in different from prognosis due to faulting. An 8 m thick Brent Group sequence (Ness Formation) came in at 3170 m, which was 180 m deeper than prognosed. The section consisted of sandstone/siltstone and was gas-bearing. The Cook Formation sandstones came in at 3236 m, 207 m deeper than prognosed, and were water-bearing. The well penetrated a large fault at 3316 m within the Amundsen Formation so that a large part of the Amundsen Formation was missing. Because of this, the Statfjord Group came in at 3353 m, which was only 44 m deep to prognosis. The Statfjord Group was oil-bearing down to 3394 m (3360 m MSL). This is the same as the oil/water contact in 34/10-2. Oil shows on cores continued down to 3447 m, and spotted shows were seen on cuttings down to 3465 m.
                


Six cores were cut in the well, one in the interval 3176 - 3189 m, four in the interval 3359 - 3447.2 and one at 3707 - 3723.5 m. The core-log depth shifts for core number one to six, in increasing order, were -1.0 m, 0.0 m, -1.3 m, -0.9 m, -1.2 m, and -1.3 m. RFT sampling was attempted at 3543.5 m (tight formation) and at 3643 m (recovered mud filtrate only).


The well was suspended on 13 July 1987 as an oil and gas appraisal well.
                


Testing




Drill stem testing was done in the re-entry by the semi-submersible Deepsea Bergen.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 34/10-33
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-33 was the sixth well drilled to reservoir level on the Gullfaks South structure. The main objective of the well was to appraise the oil and gas reserves in the Brent Group on the northern part of the structure. The gas/oil and oil/water contacts were to be confirmed at 3324 m and 3395 m MSL respectively. Secondary objective was to penetrate 50 m of the Statfjord Formation to obtain data to better understand the structural development in the area, and also update the geological model for the upper part of the formation. A positive result would lead to the drilling of a horizontal testing well as a sidetrack from this well.


Operations and results


Well was spudded with the semi-submersible installation West Delta on 25 September 1988 and drilled to TD at 3870 m in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation. There was some shallow gas at 477 - 478 m. Due to this the 20" casing was set at 450 m. There was a problem with a leakage in the BOP. The drill string got stuck when setting the 13 3/8" casing and the MWD and drill bit had to be changed. The well was close to vertical down to ca 2500 m. From there the well built inclination gradually up to 20 deg at TD. At TD true vertical depth is estimated to be ca 20 m less than measured depth. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 483 m, with gypsum/polymer mud from 483 m to 3161 m, and with gel/lignosulphonate/lignite mud from 3161 m to TD.


Top Brent Group, Tarbert Formation came in at 3186 m with gas and oil. FMT data showed a gas/oil contact at 3268 m, 85 m higher than prognosed. Approximately 150 m of oil was found vertically down to top Dunlin Group at 3424 m, much more than expected. No oil/water contact was seen. There was a pressure shift of 1.5 - 2 bar at around 3350 m, indicating two separate compartments in the oil zone. This had not been observed in the previous wells on Gullfaks South. Due to the large amount of oil in the Brent Group, the oil in place estimate was adjusted to 50 - 60 million Sm3.
                


Eighteen cores were cut in the well. One core was cut from 3152 to 3161.5 m, 14 cores in the interval 3188 to 3435 m and 3 cores from 3799 to 3840 m. The core depth was found to be from 1.00 to 3.75 m less than loggers' depth. Segregated fluid samples were obtained at 3314 m in the Ness Formation and at 3368 m in the thin Etive Formation. Sampling was attempted also at 3406 and 3406.2 m in the Rannoch Formation, but due to very low permeability no formation fluid was obtained.


The well was plugged back and classified as an oil and gas appraisal well. West Delta started the sidetrack 34/10-33A 15.12.88 at 18.30 hrs.


Testing




Four DST tests were performed in this well.
                


DST 1.1 tested the interval 3378 - 3394 m in the Rannoch Formation and produced 289 Sm3 oil and 51000 Sm3 gas /day through a 12.7 mm choke in the main flow. The GOR was 176, the oil density was 0.859 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was 0.680 (air = 1).


DST 1.2 tested the combined intervals 3378 - 3394 m in the Rannoch Formation plus 3359 - 3374 m in the Ness/Etive Formations and produced 1318 Sm3 oil and 211900 Sm3 gas /day through a 28.6 mm choke in the final flow. The GOR was 161, the oil density was 0.856 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was 0.685 (air = 1). The reservoir temperature measured in the test was ca 123 deg C at reference depth 3373 m.


DST 2.1 tested the interval 3279 - 3307 m in the Ness Formation and produced 850 Sm3 oil and 376700 Sm3 gas /day through a 19.1 mm choke in the main flow. The GOR was 443, the oil density was 0.850 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was 0.665 (air = 1).
                


DST 2.2 tested the combined intervals 3279 - 3307 m and 3311.5 - 3329 m, both within the Ness Formation, and produced 1403 Sm3 oil and 302100 Sm3 gas /day through a 19.1 mm choke in the main flow. The GOR was 215, the oil density was 0.851 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was 0.660 (air = 1). The reservoir temperature measured in the test was ca 122 deg C at reference depth 3301.5 m.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 34/10-34
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-34 was designed to drill the C6 structure west of the Gullfaks Field. Block 34/10 is situated in the Tampen Spur area and the 6C structure is an elongated, lens shaped rotated fault block dipping to the NW and bounded to the East and South by faults. At the well location the Heather Formation and uppermost Tarbert Formation have been eroded. The main objective of the well was to test the potential for hydrocarbons in the Brent Group sands west of the Gullfaks Field. No secondary prospects were defined.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/10-34 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Bergen on 10 April 1991 and drilled to TD at 2410 m in the Early Jurassic Cook Formation. While drilling the 26" hole some indications of gas was detected on ROV sonar, but no gas was observed during hole opening. Apart from some problems with stuck pipe, drilling went without significant problems. The screen from the drill string dropped into the MWD tool, thus preventing pulses from arriving at the surface. Due to this MWD is missing from 1349 m to1675 m. The well was drilled with gel/CMC down to 795 m, with gypsum/PAC from 795 m to 1994 m, and with bentonite/Lignite from 1994 m to TD.


Spotted shows were observed in limestones in the interval 1558 m to 1678 m in the Hordaland Group, through the Balder Formation and into the upper part of the Lista Formation. The Viking Group was encountered at 1991 m and consisted of only two m of Heather Formation. The Tarbert Formation sandstones was encountered at 1993 m and proved oil. From electric logs and FMT pressure measurements the OWC was interpreted at 2013.5 m, with continuous oil shows on cores extending down to 2040 m. A weak oil show was observed in an SWC from the top of the Cook Formation sandstone at 2360 m. One segregated sample was taken at 2006.0 m. The sampling time for the 2-3/4 gallon chamber was 62.3 minutes and for the one-gallon chamber 34.8 minutes. The 2 3/4 gallon chamber contained 8 litres of oil and mud filtrate and 0.58 m3 gas and the one- gallon chamber contained 1.28 1itres oil and 0.122 m3 gas. A total of 271 m conventional core was recovered in eleven cores in the Brent Group (1995 m to 2273 m). Sixty sidewall cores were attempted and 52 were recovered.
                


The well was prepared for conversion to production well and suspended on 31 May 1991 as an oil discovery.


Testing


One drill stem test was performed in the Tarbert Formation from the perforated interval: 1994 - 2001 m. The well produced 1545 sm3/d oil with a density of 0.860 g/cm3 at standard conditions and 135784 sm3/d gas with a relative density of 0.682 g/cc through a 48/64" (19.05 mm) choke.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 34/10-35
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-35 was drilled on the Tjalve Terrace south-east of the Gullfaks South field in the Northern North Sea. The objective was to test the hydrocarbon potential in the Brent Group between the Gullfaks South field and the 34/10-23 Valemon Discovery.


Operations and results


Well 34/10-23 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Ross Rig on 5 February 1992 and drilled to TD at 4310 m in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation. No significant problems were encountered in the operations. The well was drilled water based with sea water and hi-vis pills down to 1083 m, gypsum/polymer mud from 1091 mud from 1091 m to 3783 m, and with Thermopol mud from 3783 m to TD.


The well penetrated Tertiary, Cretaceous and Jurassic rocks. The Middle Jurassic Brent Group was encountered at 3912.5 m, unconformable below the Heather Formation. The Brent Group consisted of Ness Formation only. The underlying Dunlin Group came in with the Drake Formation at 3941.5 m, and the Cook Formation at 3964.5 m. Gas and condensate was proven in the Ness Formation and in the Cook formation down to top Burton Formation at 4048 m. Pressure data clearly indicated no pressure communication between the Ness and Cook Formation reservoirs. No gas-water contacts were established in the well. Oil shows in traces of sandstones (direct and cut fluorescence) were recorded over the interval 2030 m to 2100 m in the Lista and Våle formations and in the interval 2241 m to 2261 m in the Shetland Group. Cut fluorescence was recorded also in shales from the Draupne and Heather formation.


A total of 133.5 m core was cored in 13 cores. Cores 1 to 11 were cut from 3939 m to 4078 m with variable recovery from 33 to 100%. Cores 12 and 13 were cut from 4250 to 4287 m with overall recovery of 98.9%. Visual correlation of cores and well logs indicated a core shift relative to logs of  - 8 to - 9.5 m for most cores. Segregated wire line fluid samples were taken at 3921 m (mud filtrate and gas) and at 3987 m (mud filtrate, gas and condensate).


The well was permanently abandoned on 1 July 1992 as a gas/condensate appraisal well.


Testing




Three drill stem tests were conducted in the well.
                


DST 1 tested the interval 4015 to 4025 m in the lower part of the Cook Formation. It was concluded that the fluid produced came from the same formation interval as during DST 2.


DST 2 tested the interval 3984 to 3995 m, the interval with the best reservoir quality in the Cook Formation. It produced 990000 Sm3 gas/day through a 36/64" choke. The gas/oil ratio was 4500 Sm3/Sm3, the oil gravity was 0.795 g/cm3 and the gas gravity was 0.667 (air = 1). The down hole temperature recorded in the test was 150 deg C.


DST3 tested the interval 3920 to 3929 m in the Ness Formation. It produced 340000 Sm3 gas/day through a 40/64" choke. The gas/oil ratio was 3000 Sm3/Sm3, the oil gravity was 0.794 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was 0.684 (air = 1). The down hole temperature recorded in the test was 142 deg C.

Well: 34/10-36
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-36 was the sixth well drilled on the Gullfaks Sør structure. The objectives were to test the potential of Intra-Draupne Formation turbiditic sandstone, and to confirm the gas-oil contact, the oil-water contact, and the pressure regime in the Brent Group.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/10-36 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Bergen on 28 April 1992  and drilled to TD at 3640 m in the Early Jurassic Cook Formation. A 9 7/8” pilot hole was drilled from surface to 859 m to check for shallow gas. The MWD indicated several sands but all were water-filled. The well was drilled with seawater and CMC down to 1071 m, with gypsum/polymer mud from 1071 m to 3010 m, and with Ancotemp/bentonite from 3010 m to TD.


The Draupne Formation consisted of shale with only traces of sandstone stringers towards the base. The Brent Group, Tarbert Formation was encountered at 3361 m (3355.3 m TVD), 55 m deeper than prognosed. It was oil-bearing down to the OWC at 3377.5 m (3371.9 m TVD). Shows were seen down to 3397 m. The GOC was not penetrated in the well location.
                


Three cores were cut in the well. Core 1 was cut from 3029 to 3054 m in the Draupne Formation. Cores 2 and 3 were cut in the Tarbert Formation from 3363 m to 3417 m. The core shifts for cores 1, 2 and 3 were 3.0 m, 2.3 m and 2.3 m, respectively. One segregated sample was taken at 3363.8 m. The 2 3/4 gallon chamber contained 3.5 litres of oil, 3.5 litres of mud filtrate and 0.22 m3 gas. No CO2 or H2S was detected from this sample chamber.


The well was permanently abandoned on 13 July 1992 as an oil appraisal well.


Testing




One drill stem test was performed in the Tarbert Formation, from the interval 3371.2 - 3376.2 m. The well flowed 836 Sm3 oil and 161490 Sm3 gas /day through a 36/64” choke. The GOR was 193 Sm3/Sm3, the oil density was 0.869 g/cm3 and the gas density was 0.695 with 2 % CO2 and 3.5 ppm H2S. The recorded temperature was 126.1 °C.

Well: 34/10-37
Wellbore history
 





General


Wildcat well 34/10-37 was drilled in the Tampen Spur area, ca 8 km WNW of the Gullfaks Sør Field. The main objective of the well was to test the potential for hydrocarbons in the sandstones of Middle Jurassic age (Brent Group) on the Delta prospect.
                


Operations and results


Well 34/10-37 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Bergen on 26 January 1995 and drilled to TD at 2873 m in the Early Jurassic Drake Formation. No significant problems were encountered in the operations. The well was drilled with bentonite/CMC EHV down to 1525 m, and with KCl/PAC from 1525 m to TD.


Well 34/10-37 penetrated the Brent Group at 2613 m; about 58 m deeper than prognosed and the Tarbert Formation was found to be absent. The Brent Group proved to be hydrocarbon bearing with an OWC at 2645 m (2622 m TVD MSL).
                


Two conventional cores were cut from 2626 m to 2673 m in the Ness Formation. Segregated FMT samples were taken at 2624.7 m (both contained oil and gas), 2629 m (oil and gas), 2642 m (oil and gas), and at 2670 m (water with gas). The results from 34/10-37 indicated a more complex fault pattern at the crest of the structure than expected and it was decided to drill a side track. The well bore was plugged back to 2055 m on 22 February 1995 and abandoned as an oil discovery.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 34/10-38 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-38 S was drilled to appraise the 34/10-17 Rimfaks Discovery south-west of the Gullfaks field in the North Sea. The primary objective was to test the hydrocarbon potential of the Middle Jurassic Brent Group in Segment 1 of the structure. Secondary objective was to test the hydrocarbon potential of the Early Jurassic Statfjord Group in Segment 2.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/10-38 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Bergen on 5 April 1995 and drilled to TD at 3940 m (3393 m TVD) in the Late Triassic Lunde Formation. Drilling went forth without significant problem. Lost time was mostly related to logging problems in the 8 1/2" section. The well was drilled with bentonite and CMC/EHV down to 670 m, with ANCO 2000 mud from 670 m to 2075 m and with oil based Safemul PE/SE mud from 2075 m to TD.


The results of the well differed from the geological prognosis. The Viking Group and most of the Brent Group in segment 2 was eroded and the remaining of the Brent Group was heavily faulted and fractured. Top Brent Group came in at 3021 m (2653.8 m TVD). Top Statfjord Group was penetrated at 3451 m (2995.2 m TVD), about 200 m shallower than prognosed. The Brent Group, the Cook Formation and the Statfjord Group proved to be hydrocarbon bearing. Pressure samples and log analysis proved an oil-water contact at 3585.6 m (3103.5 m TVD) in the Statfjord Group. Shows and log analysis indicated, however, oil with low saturation down to approx, 3658 m.


Nine cores were cut in the well. The first core was cut from 3140 to 3159 m but recovered only a 10 cm piece. Cores 2 to 9 were cut in the Statfjord Group from 3465 m to 3631 m with generally good recovery. The core depths were from 0 to 3 m shallower than the log depths. FMT fluid samples were taken in the Brent Group at 3039.4 m (gas and condensate), and in the Statfjord Group at 3456.5 m (oil and gas), 3567.5 m (oil and gas), 3643 m (oil and water), and 3812 m (water). The oil in the sample from 3643 is believed to be residual oil mobilised by the oil base in the mud.


The well was permanently abandoned on 29 May 1995 as an oil and gas appraisal well.


Testing




Two intervals were tested in a comingled drill stem test from below and above the OWC in the Statfjord Group.
                


The main objective for DST1 A from 3637 to 3646 m was to test the type of moveable fluid below the OWC where shows, a low hydrocarbon saturation and oil in an FMT sample indicated presence of oil. The result of the test was water at a rate of 23 Sm3/day through a 64/64" choke. Only traces of oil were produced. The flowing bottom hole temperature was 113.2 deg C.
                


DST1 B tested the interval 3561 to 3570 m in the oil zone in addition to 3637 to 3646 m. DST1 B produced 858 Sm3 oil and 199056 Sm3 gas /day through a 36/64" choke. No water was produced. The GOR was 232 Sm3/Sm3, the oil density was 0.846 g/cm3, and the gas gravity was 0.807 (air = 1). The flowing bottom hole temperature was 115.4 deg C.

Well: 34/10-41 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-41 S was drilled west of the Gullfaks Field and slightly south of the Tordis Field on the Tampen Spur in the North Sea. The primary objective was to test the hydrocarbon potential in the "A-prospect" at Middle Jurassic Brent Group level. The secondary objective was to test the Early Jurassic Statfjord Group.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/10-41 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Trym on 13 July 1997 and drilled to TD at 3420 m in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Group. At 3098 m problems with steering and hole angle made it necessary to sidetrack in order to reach the planned secondary target at top Statfjord Group. The well was plugged back ca 270 m and sidetracked (34/10-41 S T2) from 2913 m. The well was drilled with spud mud down to 1050 m and with Quadrill KCl/glycol mud in both well tracks below 1050 m to TD.


The top of the Brent Group was penetrated at 2553 m, approximately 18 m above the prognosed depth, and proved to be dry. The seismic anomaly in top of the prospect turned out to be a lithology effect. From the claystone in the Heather Formation, a very calcareous sandstone was penetrated in the Tarbert Formation. It is believed that this transition to a high velocity layer is the cause of the amplitude. The Statfjord Group was penetrated at 3367.5 m and was also proven dry. Except for occasional fluorescence and cut in claystones between 2472 m and 2775 m there were no shows in the well. The lack of migrated oil was in agreement with post-well organic geochemical analyses, where extracts proved to be more or less contaminated by the mud and devoid of typical migrated hydrocarbons.


No cores were cut and no wire line fluid samples were taken in the well.


The well was permanently abandoned on 28 August 1997 as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.
--------------------------------------------------
Well: 34/10-42 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Block 34/10 covers a structurally complex area located in the Tampen Spur area of the Viking Graben. The Tampen Spur is characterized by a series of rotated fault blocks, where the major faults generally have throws towards the east and stratigraphic dips westwards. The Gullfaks Gamma structure sits on a fault terrace, down thrown from the Gullfaks Sør Field. This terrace also covers the Kvitebjørn area. The structure is a complex, faulted culmination, with a dip closure in all directions. The Gullfaks Gamma area straddles the 34/10 - 34/11 block boundary. The majority of the defined prospective elements, lie within block 34/10


The primary objectives for drilling well 34/10-42 S were to appraise economical Brent hydrocarbon reserves updip from well 34/10-23 and to test the Brent erosion model and thereby to enable a Gullfaks Gamma Field PDO. The hydrocarbon type was to be tested. A secondary objective was to test possible additional reserves in the Cook and Statfjord Formation if the well was extended through these formations. Finally, the well should add data to the field parameter database and provide a key velocity calibration point for time-depth conversion.


Operations and results


The appraisal well 34/10-42 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation "Transocean Arctic" on 15 July 1999 and drilled to TD at 4520 m (4378 m TVD RKB) approximately 40 m into the Early Jurassic Cook Formation. It was drilled deviated to avoid shallow gas Class II warnings. The well was drilled with sea water and hi-vis pills down to 1133 m, with KCl / polymer / glycol mud from 1133 m to 3666 m, and with oil based mud from 3666 m to TD. The reservoir tops came in deeper than the geological prognosis indicated. The top of the Tarbert and Cook Formations were found 174 m and 112m deeper, respectively. Both the Brent group and the Cook Formation proved to be water wet, indicating a sealing fault between well 34/10-23 and 34/10-42 S.
                


No visual shows were observed above the Viking Group. Dull, yellowish, direct fluorescence and slow streaming, milky white cut fluorescence was observed on some of the claystone cuttings from the Draupne Formation hot shale. In the sandstones of the Tarbert and upper Ness Formations, no direct fluorescence was observed, but moderate to weak, slow streaming bluish white cut fluorescence was common in the upper half of the cored section. Gas readings were recorded from the 20" shoe. The gas level was generally low, below 0.5 %, down to 3140 m where the gas content increased sharply to a higher level, 2 - 6%, reaching a maximum peak of 9.73% at 3202 m. This continued down to the top of the Viking Group. Gas levels through the Draupne Formation varied from 0.7% and up to 3.1% in the most carbonaceous intervals (C1-C5). Throughout the Heather Formation, the background gas varied between 0.6% and 3% with peaks up to 3.8%. All components from Cl to C5 were recorded. In the Brent reservoir, the gas readings were commonly showing levels slightly below and slightly above 2%, with a maximum of 7.2 % in the relatively tight, arkosic Rannoch Formation. In the Dunlin Group, gas levels were typically between 0.8 % and 2.2% with a local maximum of 6.2% at 4359 m. In a very tight, impermeable, arkosic sand near TD of the well within the Cook sandstone unit, the gas level was peaking 14.4%. One core was cut in the interval 4109 m to 4111 m in the Heather Formation and a second was cut in the interval 4217 m to 4254 m in the Ness Formation. One segregated FMT water sample was taken at 4226.4 m. A 2x20 litres preflush chamber and a 4 litres PVT chamber was run, and a total volume of 32 litres and 3.4 litres were sampled respectively. No contamination was measured offshore (tritium added as tracer in the mud), however some traces of oil are reported from the laboratory. The well was abandoned as a dry appraisal well with shows on 19 September 1999.


Testing
                


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/10-43 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Wildcat well 34/10-43 S was drilled in a structure in the south-eastern part of the Tampen Spur area, on one of the westerly-rotated fault blocks east of the Beta Ridge. The structure is eroded at BCU level, successively deeper towards the east, and is limited by east-west faults towards north. Planned well trajectory was highly deviated in order to test several objectives in one well. Primary objective was to test the potential for hydrocarbons in Middle Jurassic sandstones of the Statfjord Formation. The secondary objective was the Brent Group, Cook and Lunde Formation. Tertiary objectives were to penetrate Paleocene in an optimal position for exploring the lowermost part for sand/hydrocarbons (Ty Formation) and at TD, a prospect of the Late Jurassic, Munin Member. The planned TD of the well was at 4505 m (2565 m TVD RKB) with an inclination of 67 deg .


Operations and results


Well 34/10-43 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Transocean Wildcat on 25 February 2001 and drilled deviated through Triassic sediments of the Lunde Formation as the oldest penetrated sediments, to TD at 5725 m (3219.9 m TVD RKB) in the Early Cretaceous Cromer Knoll Group. The drilling progress was very good down to the Lunde Formation. After logging of the reservoir sections in the Middle-Early Jurassic and Triassic objectives, the drilling continued to final tertiary objective in the Late Jurassic prospect in the Munin Formation. This part was significantly slower to drill, caused by places of tight hole and also because of hard lithology. Several bits had to be implemented before TD was reached with an inclination of approximately 101 deg . The well was drilled with KCl mud down to 709 m, and with oil based mud (Versavert) from 709 m to TD.


There were no sands in the Paleocene prospect,  and the Shetland Group was therefore encountered more than 100 m shallower than expected. The Brent prospect was much more eroded at the well trajectory than was prognosed. It was thus only partly penetrated and was interpreted as water bearing. Also the Cook Formation was water bearing, and this Formation was penetrated in an optimal position in the structure. Eight m (3 m TVD) of hydrocarbons were identified on logs in the upper Statfjord- (Nansen) Formation, in a reservoir with very good properties. The OWC was at 2848 m TVD MSL. Pressure points indicated an oil zone with a density of approx. 0.05 bar/m. Middle/Lower Statfjord and the Lunde Formations showed yet another water zone. The extended part of the well penetrated Munin sands, exactly as prognosed. The sands had very good reservoir potential, yet without hydrocarbons. The well gave very good seismic reflectors in this complex sub-basin.
                


No conventional cores were cut and no fluid samples were taken in the well.


The well was permanently abandoned on 11 April 2001 as a minor oil discovery.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed

Well: 34/10-44 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-44 S was drilled under and east of the Rimfaks Discovery in the southern Tampen Spur area. The primary objective was gas injection in the Statfjord Formation Reservoir, which did not get sufficient support by the existing injector 34/10-J-1 H. The well is located in the P3 segment, situated in the northern part of the Rimfaks Discovery. The secondary objective was to drill into the Lunde Formation to investigate the hydrocarbon potential in this formation in the Rimfaks structure. Tertiary objective is gathering additional reservoir data for the Cook Formation. Coring was planned in the upper and middle parts of the formation.
                


Operations and results


Exploration well 34/10-44 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Transocean Wildcat on 30 May 2001 and drilled deviated to TD at 4865 m (3671 m TVD RKB) in the Triassic Lunde Formation. The top hole was vertical down to 226 m where the well started to build angle. The well was drilled using seawater and hi-vis pills down to 709 m, with Glydril KCl /polymer mud from 719 m to 2312 m, and with Versavert oil based mud from 2312 m to TD.


The Cook Formation was not present in the well. The well penetrated a 490 m interval with gas and condensate in a reservoir with moderate to good reservoir properties in the Lunde Formation.
                


One core was cut from 4447 m to 4492 m.


Well 34/10-44 S was suspended on 8 July 2001 as a gas/condensate discovery. It was re-entered with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Trym for production testing.
                


Testing


A production test was performed in the Lunde Formation. The test produced oil, condensate, and gas from two different zones. Testing operations were terminated on 30 September 2001 and the test interval was permanently plugged and abandoned. After testing the well was converted to gas injection well 34/10-J-4 H in the Statfjord Formation.

Well: 34/10-47 A
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-47 A was drilled in the southeastern part of the Tampen Spur 3-4 km north of the Gullveig Field and about 5 km west of Gullfaks. The well was drilled to the N7 segment, which is a rotated fault block defined by a protrusion on the main fault. Sidetrack 34/10-47 A was drilled to investigate the hydrocarbon potential in the Statfjord Formation in segment N7.
                


Operations


The wildcat well34/10-47 A was spudded on 2 November 2002 with the semi-submersible installationDeepsea Trym. The borehole was a sidetrack from 34/10-47 S with kick-off from 2215 m in the Shetland Group and TD at 3020 m (2924,8 m TVD RKB) in the Statfjord Formation, Nansen Member. The well was drilled with Versavert OBM from kick-off to TD.


Well 34/10-47 A was drilled with a more gentle curve and lower doglegs than the planned well path for well -47 A. Change in the original well-path was done to ensure that the well could be easily drilled without any steering-problems related to reaching Target 1, Top Statfjord Formation.
                


Well 34/10-47 A was found to be dry. No cores or fluid samples were taken.


Well 34/10-47 A was plugged and abandoned on 14 November 2002 as a dry well.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/10-49 A
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-49 A was drilled as a geological sidetrack to 34/10-49 S on a prospect located ca 10 km south-west of the Gullfaks Field in the northern North Sea. The primary objective of the well was to explore the oil and gas potential in the Apollo prospect in sandstones of Late Cretaceous age. Final TD was to be decided after penetrating the Brent Group. The well was the last of three well paths drilled from the 34/10-49 location to explore five different targets.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/10-49 A was drilled with the semi-submersible installation Ocean Vanguard. It was kicked off from 1274 m in 34/10-49 S on 21 May 2006 and drilled to TD at 3312 m in the Middle Jurassic Ness Formation. No reservoir was encountered in Late Cretaceous. Middle Jurassic, Brent Group sandstones were penetrated, but were found dry.


The well bore was plugged back and permanently abandoned on 10 June 2006 as dry well.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/10-52 A
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-52 A was drilled on the 10A and 10B fault segments in the southern part of the Gullfaks Sør field, located in the northern part of the North Sea. This was the first well to be drilled on these segments, and the objective for well was to prove hydrocarbons and further production potential in the Gullfaks Sør Brent Group and to support decisions on future development in the Gullfaks Sør area.
                


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/10-52 A was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Atlantic on 18 June 2011 and drilled to TD at 3520 m (3472 m TVD) in the Early Jurassic Drake Formation. It was drilled vertical down to 2150 m, then building angle up to ca 16 deg and keeping that angle down to TD. No significant technical problem was encountered in the operations. The well was drilled with sea water and hi-vis sweeps down to 245 m, with spud mud and hi-vis sweeps from 245 m to 300 m, with Polymer WBM from 300 m to 796 m, with Glydril WBM from 796 m to 2162 m, and with Versatec OBM from 2162 m to TD.


Well 34/10-52 A penetrated an incomplete Brent Group package in the Gullfaks Sør segment 10B, parts of the Tarbert and Rannoch Formations were faulted out. BCU came in at 3228 m (3191.9 m TVD), 44 m deeper than prognosed and top Brent Group came in at 3282 m (3243.8 m TVD), 91m deeper than prognosed. Initial pore pressure was measured throughout the whole Brent Group except for a smaller interval in the Ness Formation that had approximately 20 bars lower pressure. No hydrocarbon contacts were observed in the well, only down-to situations. Gas-down-to 3287 m (3249 m TVD) and oil-down-to 3314.5 m (3275 m TVD) were observed in Tarbert. Gas was observed in Ness. A WUT was observed at 3324 m (3284 m TVD). No oil shows were recorded due to the use of OBM.


No cores were taken. Wire line MRSC and MPSR fluid samples were taken at 3285.0 m (gas condensate), 3291.5 m (oil), 3320.5 m (gas condensate), and at 3328.0 m (water).
                


No cores were cut and no wire line fluid samples were taken.


The A well was permanently abandoned on 6 August 2011 as an oil and gas discovery. In order to clarify the resource potential, hydrocarbon distribution and pressure conditions in segment 10A a sidetrack was initiated, called 34/10-52 B.
                


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/10-52 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-52 S was drilled on the 10AB fault segment in the southern part of the Gullfaks Sør field, located in the northern part of the North Sea. The objective for this appraisal is to prove hydrocarbons and further production potential in the Gullfaks Sør Brent Group and to support decisions on future development in the Gullfaks Sør area.
                


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/10-52 S was drilled with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Atlantic. First spud was 5 August 2009. A 9 7/8" pilot hole was drilled from seabed 165.5 m to 800 m, to check for shallow gas. No shallow gas was observed from the pilot hole. Gas bubbles were observed at wellhead with ROV while pulling out of hole with 26" BHA. The section was displaced to 1.50 g/cc mud and no more gas bubbles were observed. No indications of hydrocarbons were interpreted on MWD/LWD logs from 9 7/8" pilot hole and 26" hole, all sand layers indicated drop in resistivity, hence water filled. Drilled 17 1/2" hole to 1516 m and lost circulation. At the same time lateral wellhead movement was observed. The bore hole was abandoned and a re-spud (34/10-52 ST2) was performed 40 m north on 15 September 2009. This well was drilled to 345 m where the well was observed flowing. The well was plugged back and 20" casing was installed at 301 m. Installed BOP and riser. Decided to suspend the operation and abandon the well due to wellhead movement and technical problems with rig equipment. The well was drilled with sweater and high viscous pills.


Target reservoir was not reached. No cores were cut and no wire line fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 10 November 2009 as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 34/10-54 A
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 34/10-54 A is a geological sidetrack to well 34/10-54 S. The wells were drilled to test the Valemon Nord prospect on the Tjalve Terrace in the North Sea. The prospect is situated north of the Valemon Field, between the Gullfaks South, and the Kvitebjørn fields. The primary objective of well 34/10-54 A was to prove commercial hydrocarbon volumes in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Group.
                


Operations and results


Wildcat well 34/10-54 A was kicked off from 2813 m in the primary well on 11 February 2014. It was drilled with the semi-submersible installation Transocean Leader to TD at 4656 m (4270 m TVD) in the Early Jurassic Raude Formation. A well influx occurred during coring at 4515 m. The flow was circulated out with the driller's method. Further drilling to TD was hampered by hole problems and sticking of drill string. The well was drilled with XP-07 oil based mud from kick-off to TD.


The Brent Group, although not prognosed, came in at 4076 m (3838 m TVD) underlying only 7.5 m Heather Formation. The Brent Group was gas bearing. The primary target Statfjord Group at 4466 m (4129 m). The well proved a gas/condensate column throughout the Brent Group with an additional gas/condensate column in the Statfjord Group. Gas/condensate was also found in the Cook Formation. Pressure sampling in both wells identified different pressure systems through the sand intervals and show most likely initial reservoir pressures. Pressures were lower than expected, below HP definition. No hydrocarbon/water contacts could be found in the Brent or Cook,  and challenging well conditions caused an early TD in the Raude Formation, which is most likely hydrocarbon filled at TD.


A total of 67.2 meters of core was cut and 60.25 meters recovered (88.34% recovery) in five cores from the interval 4252 m in the Cook Formation to 4522 m in the Statfjord Group. MDT gas/condensate samples were recovered from 4147.56 m, 4260.23 m, 4494.98 m, 4501.52 m, and 4565.3 m.


The well was permanently abandoned on 18 April 2014 as gas/condensate discovery.

Well: 34/11-3
Wellbore history
 





General


Appraisal well 34/11-3 was drilled on the 34/11-1 Kvitebj ørn Discovery in the Northern North Sea. The primary objective was to confirm hydrocarbon reserves in the Brent Group in this discovery. Secondary objective was to test the Early Jurassic Statfjord and Cook Formations. A third objective was to investigate properties of the Lista Formation of the Rogaland Group, which had significant shows in 34/11-1.


Operations and results


Well 34/11-3 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Trym on 1 August 1996 and drilled to TD at 4482 m in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation. When drilling 8 1/2" hole at 4032 m a kick situation was experienced. A total of 23.8 days was spent before the operation could be continued. After drilling to TD problems occurred with the BOP connector. A cement plug was set and the well suspended for repairs of the connector. When drilling out the cement plug the well was unintentionally sidetracked at 4009 m. 34/11-3T2 was drilled to final TD at 4230 m (4234 m loggers depth). The well was drilled with bentonite and seawater down to 1115 m, with ANCO-2000 mud from 1115 m to 3985 m, and with ANCO THERM mud from 3985 m to TD (including sidetrack).


No shows were observed in cuttings from the Rogaland Group, but in core 1 thin sandstone laminae with weak shows were observed. The top of the Brent Group was penetrated 14.5 m shallower than prognosed, and was proven to be gas/condensate bearing down to 4196.2 m. No GWC was found. No visual shows were observed in the Cook Formation.


In the Statfjord Formation, weak shows were seen, and a weak HC odour from the core was noted.


All conventional cores were cut in the original hole while all reservoir logging was performed in the sidetrack. Only MWD logs exist from the lower part of the original hole. A total of 101.8 m conventional core was recovered in 12 cores. Core 1 was cut from 2027 m to 2035.6 m in the Lista Formation, cores 2 - 11 were cut in the interval 4040 m to 4183 m in the Brent Group, and core 12 was cut from 4480 m to 4480.3 m at final TD. An FMT segregated fluid sample was taken at 4044.6 m (gas, filtrate, and 0.5 l condensate), and two MDT fluid samples were taken at 4044.5 m, and 4144.7 m. The 1-gallon MDT sample chambers contained only small volumes of mud, filtrate, some solids and hydrocarbons, the 450 cc chambers were sent to PVT lab.
                


The well was permanently abandoned on 16 January 1997 as a gas/condensate appraisal well.

Well: 34/11-4
Wellbore history
 





General


Block 34/11 is geographically located in the eastern part of the Tampen Spur, adjacent to the western controlling fault of the North Viking Graben. Structurally 34/11 is situated over a large, complex fault terrace down thrown to the south east of the Tampen Spur. The Mats Segment, which was tested with this well, is situated in the southwest part of block 34/11, and represents an easterly extension of the Gullfaks Gamma discovery in block 34/10. The Brent Group reservoir within the Gullfaks Gamma structure is within a high pressure, high temperature geological environment being at over 4000 m depth, with temperatures of 150 deg C. The main objective of the appraisal well 34/11-4 was to appraise additional hydrocarbon reserves in the Brent Group. Secondary objectives were to improve the geological / geophysical engineering parameter database, provide a key velocity calibration point to aid depth conversion, and to give a better understanding of the hydrocarbon characteristics, fluid contacts and distribution within the southern part of the 34/11 block.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 34/11-4 was spudded on 9 December 1998 with the semi-submersible installation "Transocean Arctic" and drilled to 3938 m. An unsuccessful cement job on the 9 7/8" casing resulted in backing off several joints of the casing. The casing was cut and retrieved from below the 13 3/8" shoe. The well was then sidetracked (34/11-4 T2) from 3580 m on 7 February 1999 and the 9 7/8" casing was successfully run and cemented at 3939 m. The T2 track was drilled to TD at 4438 m in the Early Jurassic Cook Formation, then logged and sampled (water and hydrocarbon samples). The initial well track was drilled with water based "Quadrill" mud containing 2 & 5 % polyols, a glycol-additive. The T2 track was drilled oil-based. Finally, an 8 1/2" sidetrack, 34/11-4 T3, was kicked-off at 4098 m on 31 March 1999 and drilled to 4210 m. This track was drilled water based to obtain high quality hydrocarbon samples as an alternative to a DST. The well was planned to take 86 days without the sidetrack, 94.5 days including the sidetrack. A total of 129.5 days was used to finish the well, including 43.4 days downtime and 6.6 days waiting time. The major contribution to the downtime was the poor cement job with the 9 7/8" casing. Further operational problem was caused by the crossover in 14 x 13 3/8" casing string had an ID less than 12 l/4"due to a mistake during fabrication. It was not drifted on board before going in the hole. The result was that 12" bits had to be used, but the availability of 12" bits was very limited, resulting in slow drilling progress.
                


The top of the Brent Group was penetrated at 4142 m and was proven to be gas/condensate bearing. Two different gas/condensate accumulations were encountered, at slightly different GOR's. The upper gas leg goes down to a shale unit at 4173.5 m TVD within the Ness Formation. PVT analysis of wire line samples showed that the GOR of this upper gas was about 4000 m3/m3. A lower gas leg extends down to another intra-Ness Formation shale al 4207.5 m TVD. This lower gas had a GOR at about 1200 m3/m3 and is one of the richest gasses proven in the area. Two hydrocarbon pressure gradients, separated by approximately 0.3 bar, were established for the two pools. No clear contacts could be defined for either gas pool and the pressure gradients showed that the lower gas is not in communication with the water leg. No visual shows were detected down to the top Jurassic except for one sample at 3210 m where traces of weak to moderate yellow fluorescence were logged. The sample did not give any cut fluorescence. This corresponds to the depth of the sudden increase in background gas to a maximum 57.45% observed from a limestone/dolomite/sandstone sequence between 3201- 3204 m. A distinct change in the amount of all the gas components occurred at this level. The gas peak represents the maximum gas readings in the well. No direct fluorescence was logged in the Viking Group. The very carbonaceous claystone of the Draupne Formation showed only a blooming to very slow streaming blue white to white cut fluorescence. The Heather Formation showed a similar cut fluorescence locally in the most carbonaceous parts. Good gas shows were logged when drilling and coring the hydrocarbon-bearing interval of the Brent Group. The sandstone showed an orange to yellow orange fluorescence in the cored section. The water bearing part of the Brent Formation did only show a weak cloudy blue white cut fluorescence. No shows were encountered in the Drake Formation and only weak cloudy blue white cut fluorescence was recorded in the Cook Formation. Two cores were cut in well track 34/11-4 T2 in the interval 4150 to 4204 m in the Ness Formation. Four FMT runs were performed and three segregated samples were taken during the TD logging of the 8 1/2" hole section in well 34/11-4T2. One water sample was taken at 4233 m, one hydrocarbon sample at 4145.8 m, and one hydrocarbon sample at 4197.8 m. In addition, the two MDT runs performed in track 34/11-4 T3 sampled hydrocarbons at 4151 m and 4194.8 m.


The well was permanently abandoned on 14 April 1999 as a gas and condensate appraisal well.

Well: 35/1-1
Wellbore history
 





General


The objectives of drilling the Sturlason 35/1-1 well were to test the hydrocarbon potential of the Jurassic Cook and Statfjord Formations and the Triassic Lunde Formation in the Marflo Ridge structural complex located northeast of the Tampen Spur. The well location was designed to test a significant hydrocarbon column height that would potentially spill into additional fault blocks without leaving commercial reserves up dip. The location should further, if possible, evaluate Paleocene potential without compromising the Mesozoic target.


Operations and results


Exploration well 35/1-1 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Bergen on 28 May 2002 and drilled to TD at 4540 m.
                


Site survey and gravity coring showed that the shallow geology at the well site consists of soft, silty clay down to 16-18 meters below the seabed. A flat topography is interspersed by frequent pockmarks (seabed depressions). These pockmarks are up to 100 meters in diameter and up to 5 meters deep and are scattered throughout the survey area. The closest pockmark is 50 m south of the 35/1-1 location. Pockmarks are believed to have formed as a result of fluid or gas escape originating in or beneath the soft surface sediments.
                


The well was drilled with seawater and bentonite sweeps down to 878 m, with KCl brine/Glydril from 878 m to 2245 m, and with Versaport oil based mud from 2245 m to TD No shallow high-pressured water pocket was encountered in the 35/1-1 drilling operation.


No producible hydrocarbons were encountered in the well. The well did not encounter any potential reservoir in the Paleocene interval. All three potential reservoir intervals were evaluated by MWD/LWD log and open hole wire line data. In the 8 1/2" hole section sidewall cores were collected and one run was performed using Schlumbergers Modular Formation Dynamics Tester (MDT) for pressure measurements and fluid sampling. The MDT tool was configured with 2 x 1 gallon chambers and 6 x 450 cc bottles for pressurized samples. Fluid samples were collected at 4043.12 in the Cook Formation, and at 4471 m and 4322.27 in the Statfjord Formation. The CPI made from the wire line log data indicated the presence of small amounts of residual hydrocarbons. Additionally, the sidewall cores and MDT samples contained traces of hydrocarbons. However, geochemical analyses showed that only the MDT sample from the Cook Formation contained trace hydrocarbons that could represent migrated petroleum. The hydrocarbons in the other samples were from the oil-based mud. It should also be noted that the potassium in the KCL/Glycol mud system masked the natural gamma ray readings of the formation in the 17 1/2" section and affected the CDR resistivity resulting in a useless LWD log. Conventional cores were not cut not in this well.


The well was permanently abandoned on 18 July 2002 as a dry hole.


Testing

Well: 35/1-2 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 35/1-2 S was drilled on the Soleie Graben Prospect on the Tampen Spur between the Knarr and Peon discoveries in the northern North Sea. The main objective was to prove commercial hydrocarbon accumulation in the Early Jurassic Cook Formation. Secondary objectives were to drill through leads in the Paleocene Lista Formation and in the Cretaceous Kyrre Formation. The well commitment was to drill 50 m into the Statfjord Formation.
                


Operations and results


Drilling was performed with the semi-submersible installation Transocean Leader. A pilot hole 35/1-U-1 was drilled first to check for shallow gas. No gas was seen. The main well was spudded 15 m south-east of the pilot and drilled to TD in 26" section. Casing and conductor were run, but due to a leak in the casing the well was abandoned and re-named 35/1-U-2. Wildcat well 35/1-2 S was spudded 15 m north-east of the abandoned on 12 September 2010 and drilled to TD at 4202 m (4122 m TVD) in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation. The Lista Formation was drilled with a 17" hole and opened up to 20" after the wire line logging was performed. Due to interbedded clay and hard limestone layers 8 runs were necessary to under ream the section. The well was drilled with sea water down to 1293 m, with Performadril mud from 1293 m to 2358 m, with XP-07 oil based mud from 2358 m to 3698 m, and with Low ECD-HTHP oil based mud from 3698 m to TD.
                


The tops in the overburden came in within the given uncertainties. Bigger differences were seen below the BCU. Five meters of Cromer Knoll Group were drilled before the Heather Formation was encountered at 3624 m. The Viking Group was thinner than expected and no Brent Group Equivalent was identified, therefore the Heather was directly in contact with the Drake Formation, which then came in 192 m shallower than prognosed. The Cook Formation came in 30 m shallower than prognosed and was thinner than expected, leading to a 75 m shallower top Statfjord Formation than expected. All the potential reservoirs and leads were dry and no hydrocarbon shows were observed.
                


Only GR-Resistivity-Density-Neutron-Sonic and sidewall cores were run on wire line. Pressure points were taken while drilling. No cores were cut and no wire line fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 19 December 2010 and classified as dry.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 35/2-1
Wellbore history
 





General


Wildcat well 35/2-1 is located on the Tampen Spur about one block west of the Agat discovery in the northern North Sea. The well should test the Peon prospect, a Pleistocene glaciofluvial / glaciomarine sand body. The very shallow prospect was based on a regional angular unconformity, an important boundary formed by glacier ice, separating steeply dipping Pliocene strata from sub-horizontal strata of Pleistocene age. The primary objectives were to test the presence and type of hydrocarbons in the prospect. The location was chosen close to the apex of a mound structure in the prospect, in an area where there was good HC indication and leaving acceptable up-dip volumes.
                


Operations and results


Well 35/2-1 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Trym on 21 July 2005 and drilled to TD at 713 m in Pleistocene sediments of the Nordland Group. The well was first spudded to the North of the final position and a 9 7/8" Pilot hole was drilled to 544 m. During drilling of the 36? hole opening the BHA parted in a drill collar connection. The BHA was left in the hole. The rig was moved 20m to the south and re-spudded. The well was drilled in a total of 39.7 days which was 5.8 days behind the AFE (33.9 days). The down time was mainly caused by operational and equipment failures including problems to get a pressure test on the P&A top cement plug. The well was drilled with water based mud.
                


Top Peon formation was found at 574 m. An 18.7 meter thick interval of dry gas was encountered in the 37.8 meter thick formation. The proven gas column was 18 m thinner than expected. The reservoir sand was homogeneous, but much unconsolidated, with likely permeability in the Darcy range. The petrophysical interpretation showed very good properties with an average porosity of 0.33, a net to gross of 0.99 and a water saturation of 0.12. The Gas Water Contact was estimated to be at 593 m (568m TVD MSL) from pressure evaluation and wire line logs. Residual gas was present in the water zone. Pressure data and PVT analysis showed that the reservoir is filled with an extremely dry gas containing 99.5 vol% methane. Analysis of stable carbon isotopes showed values around -72 to -73 ppt relative to PDB, showing a dominating biogenic origin for the gas. The reservoir pressure was 59.6 bar at 574 m (549 m TVD MSL). MDT sampling gave a temperature of 14.3 deg C at 589 m.
                


No cores were cut in the well and side wall coring failed. MDT fluid samples (gas) were collected at 587 and 593 m.
                


The well was suspended on 28 August 2005 as a gas discovery. The well would be re-entered for testing.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 35/2-2
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 35/2-2 was drilled to appraise the Peon discovery on the Tampen Spur about one block west of the Agat discovery in the northern North Sea. The objectives were to establish reservoir properties and test the hydrocarbon potential of the Peon structure, verify Sandaband as a barrier for the production wells, and test gravel pack as completion design for future production wells. Other objectives for the well were to get further information about stress in the overburden, reservoir and underburden, acquire sonic and density data from the overburden 40m over the reservoir, and collect water samples.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 35/2-2 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Transocean Winner on 2 June 2009 and drilled to TD at 640 m in Pliocene sediments of the Naust Formation. The seabed temperature was measured by two seabed memory gauges provided by Oceaneering. The seabed temperature oscillated between 5.8 to 6.7 deg C. An average of 6.3 deg C was taken as the seabed temperature. The well was drilled with seawater down to 429 m, with Sildril mud from 429 m to 571 m, and with Glydril Mud from 571 m to TD.


The geological model of Peon was confirmed by the well 35/2-2 and its technical sidetrack. Gas was encountered as expected from 580 down to a gas-water contact at 594 m in the Naust Formation "Peon sand". The gas is 99.98% methane with a carbon isotopic composition proving a biogenic origin. No oil shows were observed. A full set of wire line logs was acquired over the reservoir section; including sampling of a good quality water sample at 601 m. Sonic data was acquired in the overburden; however shear data is only available in the 8-1/2" section. Stress tests and extended leak-off tests were not done after careful consideration during risk assessments. Gravel pack as completion solution worked as expected. Unfortunately, Sandaband could not be pumped in the well and could therefore not be tested as a barrier


A core in the upper part of the reservoir was planned with the Full Closure Core Catcher", but not taken as the equipment did not work according to specifications.


The well was permanently abandoned on 26 July as a gas appraisal well.


Testing




The gas reservoir was tested with a full scale DST. The test was performed from a technical sidetrack (35/2-2 T2) drilled down to 592 m, 2 m above the gas-water contact. The test produced as expected a gas rate of 1200000 Sm3/day on a 120/64" choke size. At top reservoir the formation pressure was measured to 59.7 bars at 581m TVD RKB. The temperature recorded in the DST was 11.8 deg C, but is believed to be lower than the formation temperature due to gas expansion effects. Based also on temperatures from the MDT measurements a temperature of 12.5 deg C is taken as the Formation temperature at the top of the reservoir, 581 m.

Well: 35/2-3
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 35/2-3 was drilled on the Odden prospect in the Sogn Graben ca 10 km south-east of the Peon discovery and 76 km from the Norwegian shore. The objective was to test the Palaeocene sandstones in the Balder and Sele Formations. Planned TD was to drill 50 m into the Shetland Group or 1700 m TVD.


Operations and results


All operations on the wells were performed from the semi-submersible installation Scarabeo 8. A pilot hole 35/2-U-5 was drilled with sea water with hi-vis sweeps to 865 m due to a class 1 shallow gas warning. The well was displaced to 1.30 SG mud then a 15 minutes flow check was performed before the well was cemented back. The rig was moved to the planned main well location and the well was spudded. After drilling the 17 1/2" hole to 865 m, a water flow was observed at the well head. Due to this, the hole was cemented back and the well was abandoned. The well was renamed 35/2-U-6. The rig was moved to the alternative well location and the actual exploration well 35/2-3 was spudded on 13 June 2012. A contingency casing design was applied, installing a 20" surface casing above the suspected sandstone. The next section was drilled with weighted mud. The water flow in well 35/2-U-6 is interpreted as coming from sand layers at approximately 750 m. Well 35/2-3 was drilled without further major incident to TD at 1640 m, 50 m into the late Cretaceous Shetland Group. The main well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 562 m and with Glydril mud from 562 m to TD.


The Balder Formation came in at 1323 m and the Sele Formation at 1396 m. Both had sandstones, but no indications of hydrocarbons were seen in these formations or in any other formation penetrated by the well.


No cores were cut and no wire line fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 35/3-1
Wellbore history
 





The exploratory well, 35/3-1, was drilled on block 35/3 in the northern Norwegian North Sea, approximately 65 km west of Måløy in western Norway. The location is east of the Norwegian Trench. The general objective was to test the total stratigraphical sequence down to pre-Jurassic strata. Within the sequence, sand development was predicted for the Lower Cretaceous and the Early Jurassic, with a possibility for minor sands in Middle-Late Jurassic. The well should penetrate two seismic reflectors believed to represent top Early-pre Jurassic and basement, respectively. Planned TD was at 5250 m.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 35/3-1 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Saga on 19 July 1976. The well was terminated at 4475 m in the Dunlin Group (Middle Jurassic, Bajocian age). This was not the planned TD, but due to high pressure the well was abandoned at this depth for safety reasons. Because of this the two deep seismic reflectors were not tested in this well. The well was drilled with seawater and salt water gel/Milben mud down to 982 m, with gypsum mud from 982 m to 2474 m, and with lignosulphonate mud from 2474 m to TD.
                


A number of Tertiary sands not normally encountered in this part of the North Sea, were penetrated in this well. In the Early Jurassic, at 3805 m, a 215 m sequence of Agat Formation sandstone was penetrated. At 4145 m a 21 m sequence of Late Jurassic Intra Heather Formation sandstone was penetrated. Shows were encountered and described as follows:
                


"The first traces of hydrocarbons were encountered in Early Cretaceous sand at 3865 m. The sand gave a poor show of dead oil with no direct fluorescence, but with slow, streaming, cream cut fluorescence. Similar shows were occasionally encountered over the interval 3865 - 3975 m, partly with a fast, streaming, white cut fluorescence. At 3900 m a relatively clean, fine to medium grained silica cemented sand showed light brown stain, traces of pale yellow fluorescence, and fast, streaming, white cut fluorescence. In the Jurassic, two sand beds around 4220 m had a fair gas show of 350,000 ppm C1, 35000 ppm C2, and 13000 ppm C3 as recorded in The Analyst's unit. The sand had no stain and no direct fluorescence, but showed some scattered white cut fluorescence. A dirty sand stringer at 4225 m showed 130000 ppm C1, 23000 ppm C2 and 9500 C3, with associated scattered white cut fluorescence. General background gas in the Jurassic was 1000 ppm total."
                


Geochemical analyses showed oil maturity below ca 3200 m (%Ro > 0.5). Below ca 4100 m analyses showed abundant light hydrocarbons, indicating condensate/gas generation from Heather shales below this depth. These shales had 1.9% organic carbon on average, representing a massive source rock for condensate and gas. No conventional cores were cut and no fluid sample taken. Fifty-one sidewall cores were recovered from 2975 m to TD.


The well was plugged and abandoned on 26 October as a well with shows.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 35/3-2
Wellbore history
 





General


Whereas Saga Petroleum operated license 041, BP operated wildcat well 35/3-2 under license 041 by special agreement. The well was the second well drilled on this block, 35/3-1 was abandoned in the Middle Jurassic due to high calculated pore pressures. Well 35/3-2 was drilled on a westerly dipping fault block. The primary target of the well was Early Jurassic sandstone, secondary targets were any other Jurassic sandstones encountered.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 35/3-2 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Sedco 707 on 19 May 1980 and drilled to TD at 4400 m in ?Caledonian age basement rocks. The well was drilled with seawater and gel down to 902 m, with gypsum/CMC mud from 902 m to 2305 m, with Poly RX/Drispac from 2305 m to 3833m, and with Poly RX/Lignosulfonate mud from 3833 m to TD. The well started to flow while drilling the 24" hole.  Heavy mud was pumped down the hole, but there was very little difference between the fracture gradient and the bottom hole pressure and returns were lost several times. A loss/gain situation was maintained until the casing setting depth was reached. When running the 18 5/8" casing the string parted and 22 joints were left in the hole.  The string was recovered successfully, and a new string was run and cemented without problems.


The well penetrated strata from Tertiary through Jurassic and Triassic before reaching basement. Hydrocarbon shows were encountered in Lower Cretaceous and Lower Jurassic sands. The primary target Jurassic sandstones were found to be very tight, and no DST was carried out in these. In stead two zones in the Lower Cretaceous Sandstone were tested, producing water and gas/condensate respectively. The lower Cretaceous sands are interpreted as submarine fan deposits. The Lower Jurassic coarsening upward sequences may represent offshore open marine bars cut by tidal channel deposits and capped by a transgressive marine sheet sand. Log evaluation indicated 13.7 meters net pay in the Lower Cretaceous, with an average porosity of 15 % and an average water saturation of 64.3 %. The RFT pressure gradients suggested that a gas-water contact exists at 3585 m. Log interpretation showed moveable hydrocarbons to 3588.5 m and formation water below 3591 m. A possible 8.8 meters of net hydrocarbon bearing thin sand stringers were penetrated in the Lower Jurassic sequence.
                


Two FIT fluid samples were taken through the 9 5/8" casing. The first FIT was run at 3675.5 m. Total recovery was 1 litre of gas and 22 litres of flocculated mud with trace of oil. The second FIT was run at 3750.5 m. Total recovery was 1 litre of mud filtrate/water and 10 litres of flocculated mud. This sample had no measurable gas volume. Two RFT segregated samples were taken in the Early Cretaceous Agat Formation. A segregated sample was collected in the gas-bearing interval at 3565.5 m, and both chambers were found to contain gas only with no trace of mud filtrate. The second sample collected in the water-bearing interval at 3593 m recovered 7.5 litres of water and 13.1 litres of gas in the 2-3/4 gallon chamber, and 3.8 litres of water with 3.4 litres of gas in the 1-gallon chamber. Analysis of the water samples indicated that mud filtrate had been recovered. RFT sampling in the Early Jurassic at 4073 m, 4024.5 m, and 3939 m was unsuccessful and recovered only mud filtrate and water. Seven cores were cut in the well. Cores 1 to 4 were cut in the Agat Formation from 3593.3 m to 3641 m, core 5 was cut in the Agat Formation from 3690.7 m to 3708.3 m, core 6 was cut in the Lower Jurassic from 3944.5 m to 3960 m, and core 7 was cut in the Lower Jurassic from 3998.2 m to 4010 m.


The well was plugged and abandoned as a gas/condensate discovery (Agat) on October 1980.

Two drill stem tests were carried out in the Early Cretaceous Agat Formation. DST1 perforated the interval 3599 m to 3605 m. This test produced water at a rate of 555 Sm3/day through a 38/64" choke. The gas dissolved in the water showed no H2S and only traces of C02. DST2 perforated the intervals 3547 m to 3552, 3555.5 m to 3558, and 3562 m to 3566 m. It produced 1082000 Sm3 gas/day through a 38/64" choke. The final flow rate with the choke at 32/64 was 736000 Sm3/day. Because of a failure on the condensate metering system on the separator condensate flow rates were measured by flowtank dipping. A final condensate/gas ratio of approximately 10 bbl/MMSCF (5.6 x 10-5 Sm3/Sm3, corresponding to GOR = 18000 Sm3/Sm3) has been estimated. The gas gravity was 0.62 (air =1) and the condensate density was 0.815 g/cm3

Well: 35/3-3
Wellbore history
 





General


Wildcat well 35/3-3 was drilled in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea approximately 50 km west of Måløy, Norway. The primary target was to test the possible extension of Lower Cretaceous sandstones to the east of those encountered in wells 35/3-1 and 35/3-2. A stratigraphic trap was thought to exist in these sandstones. A secondary target was possible sandstones of Early Jurassic age with a possible pinch-out trap.
                


Operations and results


Well 35/3-3 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Byford Dolphin on 30 October 1980. It was drilled and logged to 900 m, then junked because of technical problems running the 20" casing. The rig was moved about 20 meters, and the well was respudded on 30 November 30 1980 as 35/3-4.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed

General


Wildcat wells 35/3-3 and 35/3-4 were drilled in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea approximately 50 km west of MålØy, Norway. The primary target was to test the possible extension of Lower Cretaceous sandstones to the east of those encountered in wells 35/3-1 and 35/3-2. A stratigraphic trap was thought to exist in these sandstones. A secondary target was possible sandstones of Early Jurassic age with a possible pinch-out trap.


Well 35/3-3 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Byford Dolphin on 30 October 1980. It was drilled and logged to 900 m, then junked because of technical problems running the 20" casing. The rig was moved about 20 meters, and the well was respudded as 35/3-4.


Operations and results


Well 35/3-4 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Byford Dolphin on 30 November 1980 and drilled to TD at 4089 m in Basement rocks (Caledonian age). A sidetrack was drilled from 3768 m. The well was drilled with seawater and gel down to 457m, with seawater/gel/lignosulfonate from 457 m to 879 m, with lignosulfonate/gypsum/gel mud from 879 m to 2388 m, and with gel/lignosulfonate/PAC mud from 2388 m to TD.


The well penetrated strata from Tertiary through Jurassic before reaching basement rocks-of Caledonian age.
                


Hydrocarbon shows were encountered in Lower Cretaceous and Lower-Middle Jurassic sand. The Lower Cretaceous sediments were interpreted as submarine fans. RFT measurements in Lower Cretaceous indicate an upper zone with a gas gradient of 0.4 psi/m, and a deeper zone with a water gradient of 1,54 psi/m. There seem to be no pressure communication between these two zones. Log evaluation indicate 13 m net thickness in the interval 3445 m to 3471 m, with an average porosity of 19 % and an average water saturation of 52 %.
                


Organic geochemical analyses showed poor, immature to marginally mature source rocks with limited potential for gas/condensate down to ca 3200 m. At 3200 m to ca 3650 metres zones of medium to dark grey shales have useful TOC (up to ca 3%) but are effectively immature in well position and have a negligible potential for gas (hydrogen index from 50 to 150 mg HC/g TOC).


Abundant medium to dark grey and dark olive grey shales occur in zones from 3650 m to TD.  Although they are generally poor source rocks scattered fair and good to very good interbeds are also present, notably in the Heather Formation and below 4000 m (base of Cook). The best interval was found in the interval 3695 m to 3725 m in the Heather Formation (TOC from 3.1 % to 3.8 % and hydrogen index from 260 mg/g to 360 mg/g). Their marginal maturity will, however, limit hydrocarbon generation on-structure to minor volumes of gas and associated liquids. Ten cores were cut in the Agat Formation from 3400.6 m to 3543 m and one core was cut in basement at TD from 4087 m to 4088.8 m.
                


The well was plugged and abandoned on 6 June 1981 as a gas/condensate appraisal of the 35/3-2 Agat Discovery.


Testing




Three drill stem tests were performed in the Lower Cretaceous sequence. In DST1 the intervals 3488.50 m to 3495.00, 3498.25 m to 3503.25, and 3504.50 m to 3507.75 were perforated, but no fluids were produced.  In DST2 the intervals 3445.00 m to 3447.5, 3449.25 m to 3453.5, 3454.5 m to 3459.5, and 3464.0 m to 3471.5 were perforated, but due to technical problems the test was abandoned. The final test, named DST 2A the same perforation intervals as in DST2 were used. Final gas flow rate under the first main flow period was 688000 Sm3/day and the corresponding condensate flow rate was 84 Sm3/day on a 36/64" choke. This correspond to a GOR of  8200 Sm3/Sm3. The gas gravity was 0.62 (air = 1) and condensate gravity was 50.3 °API.


Based on the test results from both 35/3-2 and 35/3-4 the reservoir encountered in 35/3-2 was interpreted as close to its dew point, while the 35/3-4 reservoir may not be. The reservoir penetrated by 35/3-4 is in a different pressure regime showing the two reservoirs to be different.

Well: 35/3-6
Wellbore history
 





General


Block 35/3 is located where the Måløy Terrace continues into the Selje High. The Selje High has a NE/SW trend, whereas the MåIøy Terrace is dominated by a N-S fault trend.
                


The objectives of well 35/3-6 were to test for commercial hydrocarbons and locate any associated hydrocarbon contacts within the Måke Nord prospect, to investigate the Albian Agat Formation, and to obtain and evaluate data required for any potential appraisal drilling.


Operations and results


The exploration well 35/3-6 was spudded on 6 February 2002 with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Bergen and drilled to a total depth of 3366 m in the late Jurassic Heather Formation. The 36" section was drilled with seawater and swept with high viscosity pills. The 9-7/8" pilot hole was drilled riser-less with seawater and high viscosity pills and displaced to 1.20 sg mud. This hole was then opened to 17 1/2" with seawater and high viscosity pills and displaced to 1.20 sg mud prior to running the 13 3/8" casing. The 12 1/4" section to TD was drilled with KCl/polymer/glycol mud (Glydril). When drilling the 36" section, a boulder bed was experienced from 270m to 275m (22 m to 27 m below seabed). This led to hole inclination going up from 1 to 3.5 degrees. After setting the 13 3/8" casing, the wellhead was inspected with the ROV and a flow was observed from below the guide base, which was partially covered by debris. After an unsuccessful attempt to stop the flow by grouting the 30" conductor and landing the BOP, a combined cement bond log and temperature log were then run. It was concluded that the water-flow originated from the Utsira Formation sands below 587 m. A bridge plug was set, the casing perforated at 568 m and a cement retainer installed. By repeated injection and partially circulation of kill mud through the perforations, the well was stabilized. A combination of a cross-linked polymer pill and low-density cement was placed in the annulus, which effectively stopped the flow.


The observed formation tops from seafloor to the primary target top Agat Formation were in accordance with the prognosis with only minor differences observed. An approximate 90 m of Agat Formation sandstone was anticipated, but only 2.5 m was present in the well location. As a consequence, both the Top Åsgard Formation and the Base Cretaceous Unconformity came in much shallower than prognosed. The 2.5 m thick Agat Formation consisted of carbonate cemented sandstone with traces of hydrocarbons. Otherwise the well encountered no hydrocarbon bearing intervals. No reservoir was found. The majority of the prospect strata are older than the Agat reservoir sandstones of the Agat Formation observed in offset wells. The space available for deposition defined by isopachs was filled with mostly Barremian shales prior to sandstone input in the Albian. This resulted in bypass and erosion rather than deposition in the prospect area during Albian times.


The cutbacks observed from the resistivity could indicate increasing pore pressure. Other parameters like gas does not confirm this but the gas readings were low and as such indicate a huge overbalance. No cores were cut and no fluid samples were collected in well 35/3-6.


The well 35/3-6 was plugged and abandoned as a dry well. The anchors were pulled on 1 of April.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed

Well: 35/3-7 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 35/3-7 S was drilled on the Cyclops prospect close to the Agat Discovery on the Måløy Slope in the Northern North Sea. The objective was to prove hydrocarbons in the Agat Formation (Agat 70 and Agat 80 sandstone units).


Operations and results


Wildcat well 35/3-7 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Bredford Dolphin on 28 June 2009 and drilled to TD at 4051 m in the Late Jurassic Heather Formation. A 9 5/8" pilot hole was drilled from 550 m down to 836 m. A water flow incident happened at 745 m. This was expected from previous wells in the area and a Riserless Mud Recovery system (RMR) was utilized to use weighted mud from seabed. By this the water flow was taken care of in a controlled manner. When setting the 9 5/8" liner the liner was lost in the well, but it was finally cemented and successfully tested 2.0 sg EMW. Due to a stuck pipe incident on a wiper trip between wire line logging runs a technical sidetrack had to be drilled to fulfil the formation evaluation program. The sidetrack was kicked off at 3248 m, below the 9 5/8" casing shoe, and reached TD at 3777 m, ca 110 m south of the primary well bore. The well took 95.8 days vs. 61.2 days planned. The additional days were mainly caused by the lost 9 5/8" liner, the stuck pipe incident including sidetrack and 10.2 days waiting on weather before pulling anchors. The entire main well bore was drilled with KCl/GEM water based mud (WBM) and the sidetrack was drilled with Performadril WBM.


The combined results of the main bore and the sidetrack was a gas discovery in the Agat formation in the Lower Cretaceous as proven by pressure data and gas samples. The pressure data combined define a GWC at 3652 m (3573 m TVD RKB, 3548 m TVD MSL) in main bore. The sidetrack hit the reservoir below the GWC. Moderate visible oil shows were primarily related to the core chips from the gas-bearing reservoir in the well 35/3-7 S. Weak oil shows on cuttings persisted below the GWC at 3652.8 m, throughout the Agat 70 Unit and down to top Agat 60 unit at 3738 m. Otherwise, weak oils shows were recorded above the reservoir in the Agat 110 unit at 3432 to 3443 m, and below the reservoir in the Agat 50 unit at 3790 to 3795 m and the Åsgard Formation at 3981 to 4003 m.


In the well 35/3-7 S, two cores were drilled out within the members Agat 80 and top of Agat 70. No core was taken in the sidetrack. The MDT tool was run to take pressure and fluid samples. In the main well bore 14 stable pressure points over the Agat 70-780 unit and a water sample from 3713 m were obtained. In the sidetrack an MDT water and mud filtrate was recovered in a sample from 3662 m. After that a dual packer mini-DST was carried out and gas samples were taken from 3646.9 m, while samples from 3646.8 and 3675.3 m only retrieved mud filtrate.
                


Preliminary estimates indicate that the size of the discovery in 35/3-7 S, together with previously proven gas discoveries in the licence (35/3-2 and 35/3-4, collectively called Agat, proven in 1980), is between three and eight billion standard cubic metres of recoverable gas.


The well was permanently abandoned on 1 October 2009 as a gas discovery.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 35/10-2
Wellbore history
 





General


Wildcat well 35/10-2 is located on the Flatfisk Slope approximately mid-way between the Fram and the Kvitebj ørn Discoveries in the Northern North Sea. The primary objective for the well was to explore the hydrocarbon potential of the Middle Jurassic Brent reservoir. The secondary objective was to explore the hydrocarbon potential of the Paleocene sandstones of the Goliath -prospect. Furthermore, the well would test the reservoir potential of the "intra Dunlin" (Cook Formation) and Statfjord sandstones. Planned TD was 5000 m MSL.


Operations and results


Well 35/10-2 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Transocean Arctic on 16 April 1996. The original well path, 35/10-2, was drilled down to a total depth of 3301 m, where the mud motor parted. A technical sidetrack, named 35/10-2 T2 was necessary. This was kicked off at 2563 and the well was drilled down to TD for the well at 4677 m in the Early Jurassic Statfjord Formation. In the 8 3/8" section, severe problems were encountered due to mud losses. The hole was cemented back once to try and seal off the loss zones. The well was drilled with bentonite down to 1460 m, with ANCO 2000 mud from 1460 m to 3990 m, and with AncoTherm mud from 3990 m to TD


No reservoir quality sandstones of any thickness were found in the Tertiary. The seismic anomaly thought to represent the Goliath prospect, was in fact caused by a sequence of thin siltstones and very fine sandstones at 1953-1955 m in the Sele Formation. Good oil shows were observed in this interval. The top of the Brent Group was penetrated at 4149 m, almost 90 m higher than prognosed, and the reservoir proved to hold a gas column of approximately 72 m. The well penetrated sandstones in the Early Jurassic, (Cook, Amundsen and Statfjord Formations), but no hydrocarbons were observed in these. Due to this the well was not drilled to the planned TD.
                


Nine conventional cores were cut in the well. Two of these were cut from 1960 m to 1974.5 m in the Lista Formation, one was cut from 2018 m to 2023.5 m in the Lista Formation, and the remaining 6 were cut from 4154 m to 4240 m in the Brent Group. FMT samples were taken in the Ness Formation at 4217.9 m (one sample: mix of mud filtrate and formation water) and at 4199.3 m (three samples: mainly mud filtrate with 1 litre gas in one of the samples).
                


The well was permanently abandoned on 22 August 1996 as a gas discovery.

Well: 35/10-3
Wellbore history
 





General


Production License 173, block 35/10, is located north-northwest of the Troll, approximately 80 km off-shore Western Norway. Well 35/10-3 is the third well drilled within the PL 173 licence area. The objective of the well was to test the hydrocarbon potential of Paleocene deep marine sandstones (Hermod Formation) of the Sele Formation in the southern part of block 35/10, known as the the Graben Fill prospect. The reservoir was expected to consist of two deep marine fans, stacked on each other.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 35/10-3 was spudded 23 June 1999 with the semi-submersible installation "Transocean Arctic". First attempt to spud failed due to boulders at 427 m. The installation was moved 20 m and after a successful second spud it was drilled to a total depth of 2250 m in the Late Cretaceous Jorsalfare Formation. The well was drilled with bentonite/PAC down to 655 m and KCl polymer mud (Ultidrill) from 655 m to TD. No shallow gas was encountered. A class 2 warning (over-pressured shallow gas) was given for a sand layer prognosed at 675 m. The Hermod Formation was penetrated at 1948 m and consisted of 35 m sandstone, as prognosed. The sandstone was water filled. Weak direct fluorescence and a few grams with cut fluorescence and increase in heavy components in the background gas was described. The prognosed lower fan proved to consist of claystone. No conventional cores were cut and no fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently plugged and abandoned as a dry well on 14 July 1999.

Well: 35/10-7 A
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 35/7-10 A is a geological sidetrack to well 35/7-10 S. The35/7-10 S well discovered oil in the Ness and Etive formations, while the Oseberg Formation was dry with shows. The objective for drilling the 35/7-10 A was to prove commercial hydrocarbons in the Oseberg Formation up flank on the structure.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 35/7-10 A kicked off at 1682 m in the main well on 12 December 2021. It was drilled with the semi-submersible installation West Hercules to TD at 3605 m (3402.8 m TVD) in the Early Jurassic Cook Formation. Operations proceeded without significant problems. The well was drilled with Exploradril oil-based mud from kick-off to TD.


Well 35/10-7 A found hydrocarbons in the Oseberg Formation in addition to condensate and oil in the Ness and Etive formations. A hydrocarbon-water contact was found at 3526 m (3325 m TVD) in the Oseberg Formation. PVT analysis classify the Oseberg hydrocarbons as a near-critical oil. The Cook Formation was dry with weak oil shows described as direct and cut fluorescence but no visible cut and no odour. Otherwise oil shows were observed only in the oil-bearing formations of the Brent Group.


One core was cut from 3391 to 3427 m with 102.2% recovery in the Ness Formation. MDT fluid samples were taken at 3396,5 m in the Ness Formation (oil), 3506 m in the Oseberg Formation (oil), and 3527 m in the Oseberg Formation (water).


The well was permanently abandoned on 27 December 2021 as an oil appraisal well.


Testing

Well: 36/1-2
Wellbore history
 





General


The exploratory well, 36/1-2, was drilled on Block 36/1 in the northern Norwegian North Sea approximately 25 km west of Måløy in western Norway, east of the Norwegian Trench. The primary target of well 36/1-2 was possible hydrocarbon bearing sandstones of the Middle and Late Jurassic. The secondary target was possible hydrocarbon bearing Early Cretaceous sandstones. The geological sequence on East Greenland shows favourable sand developments in the Lower Cretaceous and similar depositional configurations might exist in the 041/042-license area.
                


Operations and results


Wildcat well was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Saga on 26 August 1975 and drilled to TD at 3255 m in metamorphic gneiss basement. No significant problems were encountered during operations. The well was drilled with salt-water gel mud down to 650 m, with gypsum mud from 650 m to 1406 m, and with lignosulphonate mud from 1406 m to TD.
                


The secondary target Early Cretaceous sandstone (Agat Formation) was encountered from 2815 m to 2865 m. The primary target Jurassic sandstones were found to be Intra Heather Sandstone, from 3146 m to top of the basement at 3233 m. No hydrocarbons were found on logs, but shows, often characterized as "tary dead oil", were encountered from 2330 m in the Late Cretaceous Tryggvason Formation down to 3192 m in the Late Jurassic Intra Heather sandstone. The strongest shows were recorded in silty sandstone of the Agat Formation from 2815 m to 2825 m, described in well reports as " light brown stain, pale yellow fluorescence and weak, white, streaming cut, accompanied by traces of oil in mud."


One conventional core was cut over the interval 2987.4 m to 3005.8 m with 100% recovery. The core was taken on sand indication in middle Jurassic, but the recovered core consisted of shale with a thin stringer of tight siltstone. Five FMT samples were attempted in the interval 3154.5 m to 3185.5 m. Three of these recovered only mud due to no seal to the formation while one was a tool failure. The only successful sample was from 3154.5 m, from which 144 cm3 formation water was recovered. A total of 75 sidewall cores were taken between 2810 m and 3250 m. Five of these had only fractional recovery and nine had no recovery.


The well was permanently abandoned as dry with shows on 27 October 1975.

Well: 36/1-4 S
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 36/1-4 was drilled to test the Hemispheres prospect on the M l y slope in the north-east North Sea. The primary objective was to prove economic volumes of hydrocarbons in the Late Jurassic Krossfjord Formation.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 36/1-4 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Borgland Dolphin on 18 December 2021 and drilled to TD at 3255 m (3254 m TVD) in basement rock. Total NPT for the well was 193.75 hours (14.8 %) and WOW was 267.25 hours (20.4%). The main cause for NPT was lack of personnel due to health situation and problems with running 13 3/8" casing. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 307 m with Glydril mud from 307 m to 1057 m, and with Verstatec oil-based mud from 1057 m to TD.
                


The well encountered 33 m cemented sandstone within the Krossfjord Formation, with shows described as: "no stain, patchy, pale yellow direct fluorescence, slow blooming, yellow-white cut fluorescence, faint, yellow-white residual ring under UV light." Otherwise, there were no increased gas readings, no hydrocarbon signature on the logs and no significant hydrocarbon shows on the cuttings.
                


Due to dry well no cores were cut and no pressure measurements or wireline data or fluid samples were collected.


The well was permanently abandoned on 30 January 2022 as a dry well.


Testing

Well: 6204/10-1
Wellbore history
 





General
                


The objectives of well 6204/10-1 were to prove economic hydrocarbon reserves in the J-prospect (Turonian) and support play concept and possibly prove hydrocarbon reserves in the Jurassic lead. Further objectives were to achieve stratigraphic information and possibly prove reservoir sand and new play concepts in the Tertiary, Turonian and Cenomanian levels.
                


Operations and results
                


Well 6204/10-1 was spudded with the semi-submersible rig "Deepsea Bergen"on 28 October 1995 and drilled to 2709 m in basement rock within the planned budget. The 30", 13 3/8" and 9 5/8" casing strings were successfully set. No drilling problems were encountered. The well was drilled with seawater / bentonite hi-vis pills / ANCO 2000 to 490 m and with KCl polymer mud from 490 m to TD. Four cores were cut, one in Tertiary and three in Cretaceous. No fluid samples were taken.
                  
The well proved the geological model of the J- prospect. Unexpected conglomeratic sandstones devoid of fossils, probably eroded basement, were encountered in the lower part of the well and the well was terminated before reaching the planned TD.
                  No hydrocarbons were encountered, and the well was plugged and abandoned as a dry well.

General
                


The main objectives for well 6204/10-2 was to prove economic hydrocarbon reserves in the Jurassic L-prospect and in the Coniacian/Turonian Q-prospect, while secondary objective was to investigate possible hydrocarbons in fractured basement.
                


Operations and results
                


The 6204/10-2 well was spudded with the semi-submersible rig "Deepsea Trym" on 19 January 1997 and drilled to a temporary TD at 1145 m, where the well was temporarily abandoned on 21 november due to environmental restrictions. Well 6204/10-2 R was re-entered on 4 November 1997, and was drilled to TD at 2095 m. The well bores were drilled with a water based KCl polymer system, however, standard geochemical analyses indicate unknown additives that may affect geochemical analyses. No special drilling/operational problems were experienced in this well.
                  The well showed that the Jurassic section was missing, and there were no hydrocarbons in the basement. The only hydrocarbons encountered were in a thin Lower Cretaceous sandstone stringer, where a segregated FMT sample at 1915.5 m gave a good sample from a porous sandstone. Two cores were cut: one at 1872 - 1889.55 m in Upper Cretaceous and one at 1951 - 1961.14 m in Lower Cretaceous. The well was plugged and abandoned on 21 November 1997 as a gas discovery.

Well: 6204/11-1
Wellbore history
 





General
                


The main objectives for well 6204/11-1 was to test commercial reserves of hydrocarbons in sandstones of Middle Jurassic age and in sandstones of Turonian age. A secondary objective was to test the play concept and possibly prove hydrocarbons in an Upper Jurassic sandstone.
                


Operations and results
                


Well 6204/11-1 was spudded on 10 October 1994 with the semi-submersible rig "Deepsea Bergen" and drilled to 2966 m in the Triassic Grey Beds. The 30", 20" and 13 3/8" casings strings were successfully set. The 9 5/8" casing was planned but left out. The 12 1/4" hole was drilled using a packed bottom hole assembly. The vertical hole was obtained at high weight on bit and reduced bottom hole assembly failures due to shock / vibration effects. No drilling problems were encountered. The well was drilled with pre-hydrated bentonite (PHB) to 540 m, and KCl polymer mud from there to TD.
                  
The well proved, with some exception, the geological model. Sandstones of both Upper and Middle Jurassic age were encountered. The well was however terminated in Triassic sediments not in the basement as prognosed.
                  The well proved hydrocarbons with low saturation from 2029 to 2046 m in sandstone of Turonian age. The top of the Jurassic prospect was penetrated 23 m deeper than prognosed and proved to be gas bearing. The gas-water contact was found at 2792.5 m TVD RKB (2769.5 m TVD MSL). Good oil shows were observed in the cores below the gas-water contact and measurements from the cores indicate immature oil with low saturation below the gas - water contact.
                  
Six cores were cut, three in the Cretaceous and three in the Jurassic. FMT and RCI wire line samples were taken at 1938 m (gas and mud filtrate), 2032.5 m (mud filtrate and small amounts of oil), 2043.8 m (mud, mud filtrate, and oil film), and 2787 m (mud filtrate and gas).
                  
The well was plugged and abandoned on 14 November 1994 as as a gas discovery.

Well: 6204/11-2
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 6204/11-2 is located in the eastern part of the Slørebotn sub-basin, ca 3 km east-northeast of well 6204/11-1. Well 6204/11-1 proved shows in the Cretaceous Lysing Formation Equivalent and made a sub-commercial gas discovery in the Middle Jurassic. The objectives of well 6204/11-2 were to prove hydrocarbon reserves in the I-prospect, in a Coniacian/Turonian Sandstone and in the O-prospect, an Albian/Aptian Rødby Sandstone
                


Operations and results


Exploration well 6204/11-2 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Trym on 6 December 1997 and drilled to TD at 2920 m in the Late Jurassic Sognefjord Formation. The well was drilled with seawater and PAC sweeps to 1352 m and with PAC / KCl mud from 1352 m to TD.
                


The 6204/11-2 well proved no hydrocarbons in the I- and O-prospects. This has been deduced by FMT sampling and petrophysical evaluation of wire line logs. The O-prospect was prognosed to be sandy, but a conglomerate was encountered. Gas readings were low throughout the well. The highest readings were in the claystones above the Lysing Formation Equivalent, ranging from less than 0.1 % to 0.6%. Traces of fluorescence were reported at several intervals throughout the well below 1984 m. Only in the Sognefjord Formation (2892 m to TD) moderate direct fluorescence were observed, but the poor cut fluorescence compared with the moderate direct fluorescence indicates residual HC only, in accordance with the wire line logs. FMT fluid samples were taken at 1992.3 m and at 2893.0 m. Both 10 l chambers were drained off shore and were observed to contained mud filtrate and formation water. Oil film was observed in the sample at 1992.3 m, but analysis showed that it was from a base oil, either due to lack of cleaning of the FMT chamber prior to use or due to trace of base oil in the mud used in the well. No cores were taken. The well was permanently abandoned as a dry well with shows on December 28t 1997.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 6204/11-3
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 6204/11-3 was drilled to test the Schweinsteiger prospect in the northern part of the Måløy Slope in the northern North Sea. The primary objective was to prove producible hydrocarbons in the Cretaceous Åsgard Formation.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 6204/11-3 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Borgland Dolphin on 14 September 2020 and drilled to TD at 1321 m, 50 m into Basement. A 9 7/8"  shallow gas pilot hole was drilled from 307 to 631 m. Shallow gas was observed at 331 m. Visible gas bubbles were seen that lead to pumping of kill mud. The well was killed with no visible gas observed by the ROV. Operations proceeded without significant problems. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 307 m and with Glydril mud from 307 m to TD.
                


The target Åsgard Formation sandstone was not encountered. Instead, the well encountered 140 m of undifferentiated Cromer Knoll Group siltstone with sandstone and limestone stringers from 1084 - 1224 m. The well also penetrated a 47 m section of undifferentiated Jurassic of interbedded sandstone, siltstone, and claystone from 1224 to 1271 m. The basement also consisted of sandstone. All sandstones were water bearing with no oil shows.
                


No cores were cut. No fluid sample was taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 14 September as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 6305/9-1
Wellbore history
 





General


The exploration well 6305/9-1 was drilled on the "Blåveis" prospect in the southeastern part of the block, east of the Ormen Lange Field. The main objective of the well was to test if hydrocarbons were present in the Tertiary Egga Member in the Våle Formation, and in the Maastrichtian Springar Formation sandstones.


Operations and results


Wildcat well 6305/9-1 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Transocean Arctic on 9 July 2001 and drilled to TD at 2655 m in the Late Cretaceous Springar Formation. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 680 m and with GLYDRIL KCl/polymer mud from 680 m to TD.


In the Lower Paleocene an Egga Member sandstone of the Våle Formation was found, with good sands that became increasingly interbedded with claystone towards top of the underlying Springar Formation. The clean sandstone intervals were high porosity - high permeability reservoirs. No hydrocarbon indications were observed. One core was cut in the Egga Member, covering 17.4 m of the 54 m thick sandstone. The core shows a deposition within stacked channels and related overbank areas of intraslope basin turbidite system. The reservoir properties in the cored interval show 27.5% porosity and 2280 mD permeability. No core was taken in the Springar Formation. The reservoir quality of the Springar Formation clean sands is about similar to the Egga Member but the net sand fraction is less. The geology of the well was very much as prognosed, especially the formation tops in the lower part of the well came in almost as prognosed. The formation pressure in the lower Tertiary was hydrostatic. Organic geochemical analysis showed vitrinite reflectance Ro values in the range of 0.35-0.40 for the Egga reservoir sandstone and Springar Formation, which means that source rocks at this level are thermally immature for hydrocarbon expulsion. Extracts from samples of the Egga Sandstone and Springar Formation gave only traces of early mature, locally derived hydrocarbons. No fluid sample was attempted.


The well was permanently abandoned on 31 July 2001 as a dry hole.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 6305/12-1
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 6305/12-1 is located in the southwestern part of block 6305/12 in the Slørebotn Sub-basin, approximately 12 km west of the island of Vigra. The C-prospect is an easterly tilted fault block bounded to the west by the Gossa High. The primary objective of the well was to prove hydrocarbons in Early to Middle Jurassic sandstones. Late Triassic sandstones were secondary objectives. The well was designed to leave only non-commercial resources up-dip with a total depth of 4300 m in rocks of presumed Late Triassic age. If the encountered stratigraphy below the base Cretaceous was younger than expected, deeper drilling for stratigraphic information would be considered.
                


Operations and results


Wildcat well 6305/12-1 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Transocean 8 on 29 July 1991 and drilled to TD at 4302 m in Triassic Red Beds conglomerates. No significant problems were encountered during drilling, which was completed in 55 days compared to prognosed 81 days. The well was drilled with seawater and hi-vis pills down to 721 m and with KCl/polymer mud from 721 m to TD.


The Egga Informal Sand Unit was encountered at 1804 m. It contained ca 145 m net sand with 19.7% average porosity. Thinly developed sandstones were encountered from 3260 m in the Late Cretaceous Lange Formation and down through to base Early Cretaceous at 3685 m. At 3685 m there was a hiatus from Late Albian (Base Lange Formation) to Bathonian, hence the Late Jurassic source rocks were not present in the well. The Middle Jurassic unit exhibited interbedded thin sandstones, coals and claystones. No shows were recorded while drilling the Egga sandstone, but post-well organic geochemical extraction proved a weak show at 1810 m. The logs showed a water wet Egga reservoir. The Lange sandstones generally displayed poor direct and cut fluorescences while being drilled, and proved later to be oil-bearing, though tight, in subsequent RFT runs. Moveable oil in this section was confirmed by petrophysical evaluation, which detected a 3.75 m net pay with an average of 14.4 % porosity. Chromatographic analysis of drilled gas showed C4's to be present from ca 3150 m in the Late Cretaceous through to the Early Cretaceous and Jurassic, where they gradually diminished towards the base, and disappeared below 3970 m. A trace of oil was observed to be seeping from fractures in a thin coal band at 3692 m in core l in the Middle Jurassic. Organic geochemical analyses showed that the best source rocks were the coals and shales of the Middle Jurassic. In addition a Blodøks Formation Equivalent at 3140 m to 3158 m within the Lange Formation may have some potential (TOC = 2.2% and HI = 165 mg HC/g TOC in a single SWC sample), but this unit is only 18 m thick. The well is immature for petroleum generation down to 2600 m, early mature from 2600 m to 2900 m, and in the oil window from 2900 m to ca 4000 m. Analyses of the oils and extracts showed that the Egga and Lange oils and extracts probably derived from a marine source rock while the oil from the Middle Jurassic was confirmed as a locally sourced coal-bleed.
                


Three cores were cut: one in the Middle Jurassic and two in the Triassic Red Beds, including one at TD. Two cased-hole RFT runs were performed, obtaining two sets of fluid samples from 3331 m and 3455.6 m in the Lange Formation sandstones. No reliable pressures were obtained, however small volumes of (ca 0.2 litre) of heavy, emulsified oil were recovered in both samples. A total of 240 sidewall cores were attempted and 160 were recovered.


The well was permanently abandoned on 18 September 1991. It proved non-commercial volumes of live oil and is classified as a well with shows.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 6306/5-1
Wellbore history
 





Wildcat well 6306/5-1 was drilled ca 190 km West of the town Trondheim, on the Klakk Fault Complex, which forms the border between the FrØya High and the MØre Basin. The two main objectives were to test the hydrocarbon potential of two Palaeocene prospects: the Eirikson prospect and the Nansen prospect. When drilled these prospects were prognosed as the Heimdal Formation sandstone and a new informal "Skalmen Formation sandstone", respectively. Only the Skalmen Formation was confirmed by the well. Later this formation has been encountered in other wells in the area as the (informal) Egga Formation.
                


Operations and results


Wildcat well 6306/5-1 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Deepsea Trym on 8 June 1997. Operations went without significant problems down to the 8 1/2" section. This section was drilled from 1300 m to 1751 m, top of the Egga reservoir. This was found to be significantly over pressured and a large gain was taken. The well was shut-in and steps were taken to kill the well. The operation was complicated by the discovery that the pipe was stuck. The string was finally cut at 1477 m, and a cement plug was set to be used as kick-off plug for a sidetrack around the fish. The sidetrack was kicked off at 1365 m and drilled to TD at 2050 m in the Late Cretaceous Kvitnos Formation without further problems. The well was drilled with bentonite and seawater down to 1001 m and with ANCO 2000 mud from 1001 m to TD.


No shallow gas or boulder beds were encountered in the uppermost well section. The well penetrated mainly clays and claystones in the Nordland, Hordaland and Rogaland groups with minor sands developed and limestone stringers present. The prognosed Heimdal Formation sands were not present. Top Egga sand was reached at 1751 m and was 12 m thick. The lithology of the Egga sand was mainly a clean sandstone divided in two by a calcareous clay stone. Top of the Egga reservoir was re-penetrated in the sidetrack at 1750 m, consisting of an upper clean sand, a shaly unit, and a thin lower sandstone bed that continued down to top Shetland Group at 1762 m. The Shetland Group consisted mainly of claystone and siltstone with minor dolomites. There were no oil shows recorded in this well. Post well organic geochemical analysis indicated mainly biogenic gas down to approximately 1650 m. Below this depth the gas was a mixture of migrated thermogenic and shallow generated biogenic/diagenetic gas. Hydrogen Index (HI) suggested fair gas and oil prone shales present in both the lower Hordaland Group and lower Tang Formation. All Formations penetrated were however immature in well position. One conventional core was cut in the Early Palaeocene Egga reservoir sand from 1757 m to 1775 m. Only 5.1 m (28.3%) was recovered. Two segregated MDT samples were taken in the Egga sand at 1755.8 m (1728.1 m TVDSS). The contents were water, mud filtrate and gas.


The well was permanently abandoned on as a minor gas discovery.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed in the well.

Well: 6407/6-7 S
Wellbore history
 





General


The 6407/6-7 S Harepus well was drilled on the eastern limits of the Halten Terrace, adjacent to the Trøndelag Platform offshore Mid Norway. The main objective was to prove hydrocarbon bearing sands in the Middle Jurassic Garn and Ile Formations (Fangst Group). Secondary objectives were to test the hydrocarbon potential of the Ror, Tilje and Åre Formations.


Operations and results


Well 6407/6-U-2 (pilot hole) was spudded and drilled to a total depth of 437 m. A drill break and a drop in gamma measurements indicated a sand layer from 436 - 437 m. Shallow gas was observed at seabed surface by ROV sonar during the connection at 437 m. The well was killed with 1.60 SG kill mud and plugged back to surface with three cement plugs.
                


Wildcat well 6407/6-7 S was spudded with the semi-submersible installation Ocean Vanguard on 12 April 2009 and drilled to TD at 3227 m (3184 m TVD) in the Early Jurassic Åre Formation. The well was designed as a vertical well down to ca 1710 m in the 12 1/4" hole section and directionally drilled from the 12 1/4" section to hit the geological target at a 15 deg angle, holding this inclination to TD. No shallow gas was observed while drilling the 36" and 17 1/2" hole sections. The well was drilled with Seawater and hi-vis sweeps down to 422 m, with 1.15 SG WB spud mud from 422 m to 1149 m, with Performadril HPWBM mud from 1149 m to 2701 m, and with Performadril mud from 2701 m to TD.
                


The well penetrated rocks of Quaternary, Tertiary, Cretaceous, and Jurassic age. TD of the well was in the Åre Formation. Base Cretaceous/Top Spekk Formation was encountered at 2685 m with Late Jurassic Rogn Formation sandstone coming in at 2747 m (2716.2 m TVD) and a second Spekk Formation interval at 2765.7 m (2734.3 m TVD). Eroded Middle Jurassic Garn formation was encountered at 2777.3 m (2745.6 m TVD, 40 m deeper than predicted. Gas with condensate was proved in the Rogn and Garn Formations with a gas down to (GDT) proven in the Garn formation. The Garn formation pressure was 28 bar depleted and the pressure plots could not be used to determine gas-water-contact (GWC). From pressure points and logs gas is seen down to 2813.4 m (2780.6 m TVD) and water up to 2827.2 m (2794.0 m TVD). No hydrocarbons were seen in the Early Jurassic Båt Group.


No oil shows were seen in the well apart from some weak cloudy bluish white cut fluorescence, and in parts, a greenish yellow residual in core chips from the reservoir section.


One core was cut from 2756.5 to 2778.8 m in the Rogn and Garn Formations. Good quality gas samples were collected with the MDT single probe equipment in the Rogn Formation at 2764 m, 2764.7 m, and 2770.8 m and in the Garn Formation at 2784.1 m. No water samples were collected due to hole conditions.
                


The well was permanently abandoned on 27 May 2009 as a gas discovery.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 6407/8-4 A
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 6407/8-4 A is a sidetrack from the Galtvort well 6407/8-4 S, located on the eastern margin of the Gimsan Basin in the Norwegian Sea, ca 7 km northwest of the Draugen Field. A main fault separates the middle and northern segments of the Galtvort structure from the southern segment. The southern segment was tested in well 6407/8-4 S and found gas in the Fangst Group. The primary objective of the sidetrack was to test the hydrocarbon potential of prospective formations in the middle and northern segments in order to test the sealing potential of the main fault crossing the structure.
                


Operations and results


Wildcat well 6407/8-4 A was drilled with the semi-submersible installation West Alpha as a sidetrack. It was kicked off from a milled window (1497 - 1502 m) in the 13 3/8" casing in 6407/8-4 S on 22 May 2008 and drilled to TD at 2473 m (2319 m TVD) in the Early Jurassic Åre Formation. The well was drilled with Glydril mud from kick-off to TD. No significant technical problems were encountered in the operations.
                


Prior to drilling it was prognosed that the sidetrack should penetrate the same formations as well 6407/8-4 S. Due to a much larger fault throw between the Middle and the South Galtvort Segments and hence more extensive uplift and erosion of the Middle and North Segments than anticipated, the entire Fangst Group was eroded. As a result the well penetrated directly from the Cretaceous Kvitnos Formation and into the Båt Group at 2117.8 m (2026.7 m TVD). The upper part of the Båt Group consisted of Ror Formation mudstones and only thin Tofte equivalent sandstones of mediocre reservoir quality. The underlying Tilje Formation came in at 2217 m (2106 m TVD) and was gas bearing down to a GWC somewhere in the interval 2175 to 2183 m TVD SS. Weak oil shows were observed in cuttings between 2226 m to 2274 m in the Tilje Formation. Otherwise no oil shows were observed in the sidetrack wellbore.


No cores were cut in this wellbore. MDT wire line gas samples were taken at 2219 m, 2120.4 m, and at 2121 m. Sampling was performed with only a few bar drawdown and the samples are believed to be representative of the formation fluids.


The well was permanently abandoned on 16 June 2008 as a gas discovery.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 6407/9-5
Wellbore history
 





General


Well 6407/9-5 was the fifth well drilled on the Draugen Field in the southern Haltenbanken area. Wells 6407/9-1, 6407/9-2 and 6407/9-3 delineated an areally extensive oil accumulation in relatively thin Late Jurassic Rogn Formation sandstone. Net oil sand thicknesses in these wells were 39, 12 and 34 m respectively. The oil gravity was 40 deg API. Well 6407/9-4, located on the west flank of the northern accumulation, confirmed pinch out of the Rogn Formation and encountered similar oil in the underlying Garn formation. The initial conditions of pressure and oil water contact in this well (1638.5 m MSL were similar to those in the Rogn Formation accumulation. The objectives of well 6407/9-5 were to delineate top structure and rock qualities in the southern culmination. Prognosed TD was 1805 m in rocks of Triassic age, or a maximum depth of 4000 m.


Operations and results


Appraisal well 6407/9-5 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation West Venture on 12 September 1985 and drilled to TD at 1820 m in the Early Jurassic Not Formation. Drilling proceeded without serious problems, except for the sections trough glacial deposits were huge boulders caused minor problems. The well was drilled vertical. Deepest reported deviation survey was at 1675 m (1675 m TVD RKB). To this depth maximum deviation from vertical was 0.66 deg. The well was drilled with seawater and bentonite down to 811 m, with KCl/polymer mud from 811 m to 1625 m, and with chalk mud from 1625 m to TD.


The Rogn Formation was encountered at 1654 m, 15 m deeper than prognosed. Light oil was discovered, as known from the other wells in the Draugen field. The oi1/water contact was found at 1671 m (1639 m MSL), the same contact as in the other wells drilled on the Draugen Field. Average reservoir quality over this 17 m interval was good, with a calculated hydrocarbon saturation of 76% and a porosity of 27%. Core permeabilities from the oil interval typically ranged between 1 and 10 Darcy. The base of the Rogn Formation, from 1704.0 - 1734.0 was laminated, bituminous shales with occasionally sandy and silty beds, which were strongly pyrite cemented. This interval forms a thick impermeable layer between the Rogn and the underlying Garn sands. The underlying water bearing Garn Formation contained 32 m of sandstone with 32 % average porosity. Oil shows were recorded only in the Rogn Formation reservoir from top and down to 1675 m. No shows were seen elsewhere in the well.


Four cores were cut in the interval 1654 - 1703 m in the Rogn Formation. No fluid samples were acquired on wire line, although several attempts were made.


On completion of the testing the well was suspended on 13 November 1985 as a possible future oil producer. It was re-entered in April 1993. It was taken in use as an oil producer and renamed 6407/9-A-55 H.


Testing


One DST test was performed in the interval 1654 - 1661 m (1621 to 1628 m MSL).


The well produced up to a maximum of 1210 Sm3 oil /day of 40 deg API oil through a 1" choke. Separator GOR was measured at 18.2 Sm3/Sm3. The gas gravity was 0.818 (air = 1) with 0.35% CO2 and 0 ppm H2S. Initial reservoir pressure was calculated as 2394 psia at 1663 m (1630 m MSL). The previously established Draugen reservoir pressure of 2392 psia (at datum) was within the accuracy of the gauges.

Well: 6407/12-1
Wellbore history
 





General


Exploration well 6407/12-1 is located on the western edge of the Trøndelag Platform in PL176, some 13 km South of the Draugen platform. It was drilled to test the hydrocarbon potential of the Upper Jurassic sands of the Rogn Formation, which is the main reservoir unit in the Draugen Field. The second objective was to log and sample the upper 20 m of the Middle Jurassic Garn Formation.
                


Operations and results


The well was spudded on 7 July 1999 with the semi-submersible installation "Mærsk Jutlander" and drilled to a total depth of 1805 m in sandstone of the Garn Formation. It was drilled with sea water and Hi-vis bentonite pills to 714 m and with BARASILC silicate mud from 714 m to TD. The well found 2.3 m of oil-bearing sands in good quality reservoirs of the Rogn Formation. The Rogn Formation in the well is in pressure communication with the Rogn Formation reservoir of the Draugen Field. An oil MDT sample was acquired from 1660.7 m in the Rogn Formation. Sampling occurred extremely slowly despite a recorded mobility of 249 md/cp and a high porosity indicated from the density log. This suggests potential plugging of the probe due to the unconsolidated nature of the Rogn sandstone. The Garn Formation came in at 1763 m. No conventional core was cut in the well. The well was plugged and abandoned on 15 July 1999.

Well: 6610/7-2
Wellbore history
 





General


Wildcat well 6610/7-2 is located on the Trøndelag Platform outside Mid Norway. The primary objective of the well was to test the hydrocarbon potential of Early Jurassic and Late Triassic sandstones. Secondary objectives were to gather information about the stratigraphy and hydrocarbon potential down to approximately 4200 m.
                


Operations and results


Wildcat well 6610/7-2 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation West Vanguard on 28 August 1983 and drilled to TD at 4215 m in the Triassic Grey Beds. Drilling operations were problematic and took 119 days more than programmed. Excessive reaming of tight spots had to be done during drilling of the 22" hole section. In all the four first hole sections a pilot hole was drilled before underreaming. Nineteen kg junk was recovered from the hole after drilling out of the 13 3/8" casing shoe. Several problems with stuck pipe occurred below 3000 m. At 3526 m the pipe was stuck and was backed off at 3315 m. A cement plug was set from 3292 to 3148 m and the hole was sidetracked from 3212 m. Severe problems with tight hole, was experienced down to 3361 m. The well was drilled with seawater and spud mud down to 701 m, with gypsum/lignosulphonate mud from 701 m to 2160 m. Due to expected salt beds below 2500 m the well was drilled with oil based mud from 2160 m to TD. The oil base used was a Norol product, "hvitolje", a low-aromatic mineral oil C13 - C20 distillate.


The well encountered several sandstone bodies, the first interpreted as the Egga Informal Unit in Paleocene. Earliest Cretaceous - Late Jurassic were not present in the well. At 1487 m the Early Jurassic Båt Group was encountered with massive and porous sandstone sequence. The Triassic interval 3473 - 4218 m also had some clean sandstone, especially in the upper part. Electrical logs and RFT pressure tests, however, proved all potential reservoirs to be water bearing. Organic geochemical analyses showed that the units with the best source rock properties in this well are the shales and coals of the Early Jurassic Tilje and Åre Formations, which can be classified as rich type II/III source rocks with potential for gas and oil. However, shales in the upper 100 m of the Triassic Grey Beds also have fair to rich contents of organic matter classified as type III kerogen with some potential for gas. The well is immature down to approximately 2300 m, reaches peak oil generation maturity (0.8% Ro) at around 2900 m, while base oil window is considered at around TD in the well. Hence, the Early Jurassic coals and shales are immature in the well position. Free hydrocarbons thought to be due to migration are detected only in a siltstone sample from 1504 m in the Tilje Formation.


Two cores were cut, one in the Early Jurassic sequence and one in the Grey beds close to TD. No fluid sample was taken. The sample available at the NPD is a sample of the base oil used in the drilling mud.


The well was permanently abandoned on 14 March 1984 as a dry hole.


Testing


No drill stem test was performed.

Well: 6610/10-1
Wellbore history
 





General


The 6610/10-1 Lovund well was drilled about 120 kilometres northwest of Sandnessjøen and about 90 kilometres northeast of the Norne field. The main objective of the well was to prove petroleum in Lower Jurassic reservoir rocks (the Båt Group) in the Helgeland Basin, where eight wildcat wells have been drilled in and around the basin. The play in the area has not been confirmed. A secondary objective was to evaluate potential source rocks in the Åre Formation


Operations and results


Well 6610/10-1 was spudded with the semi-submersible installation West Alpha on 1 January 2013 and drilled to TD at 3006 m in the Late Triassic Grey Beds. No significant problem was encountered in the operations. No shallow gas was observed. The well was drilled with sea water and hi-vis sweeps down to 1051 m, with KCl/polymer/glycol mud from 1051 m to 2110 m, and with Low sulphate KCl/polymer/glycol mud from 2110 m to TD.


In the overburden, the well penetrated Tertiary, Cretaceous and Upper Jurassic claystones and sandstones. In the reservoir, the well penetrated sandstones, claystones and siltstones of Jurassic age, within the Tofte, Tilje and Åre formations. The Åre Formation was encountered at 2657 m and was 273 m thick. Åre comprises an upper part with abundant sandstones and a few coal beds, and a lower more carbonaceous part with  less sandstones and numerous beds of coal, brown coal, and Carbonaceous shales. The Grey Beds are interpreted from the last observed coal in the Åre Formation at 2930 m. No moveable hydrocarbons were encountered in the well. No hydrocarbon shows were observed in the well, however trace residual shows were observed in the sidewall cores from the Tilje and Åre formations.


No cores were cut. Dry hole wire line logging was performed and no wire line fluid samples were taken.


The well was permanently abandoned on 3 February 2013 as a dry well.


Testing




No drill stem test was performed.
